Lino is a high-level framework for writing desktop-like web applications
based on `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_
and `Sencha ExtJS <http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/>`_.

Lino is for IT professionals who want to develop customized database 
applications for their customers without writing any HTML or CSS.

Lino consists of different parts:

- `django-site <http://site.lino-framework.org>`__
  (split off from main project in March 2013)
  provides startup signals and the `settings.SITE` object.
  
- `django-north <https://code.google.com/p/django-north/>`__
  (split off from main project in March 2013)
  provides python dumps, multilingual database content and data migration.

- A collection of reusable Django apps and 
  out-of-the-box demo applications
- A collection of *user interface renderers*.
  Currently there's one for ExtJS 
  and another for Twitter/Bootstrap-based "plain" interface.

The following real-world applications use the Lino framework:
