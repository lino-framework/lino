Tamino XML Server is the first XML platform to store XML information

integrates relational or object-oriented data into XML structures.
</quote>

<p>Luc: But XML is not a data storage format?

<p><quote>
The XML engine in Tamino XML Server (...)  has been designed for
URL-based access.  It cooperates with existing standard HTTP servers.
(...)  Tamino XML Server's query language X-Query is based on the
XPath standard. This allows for powerful queries on stored documents
as part of a URL issued either via standard Web browsers or through an
application.</quote>

<p>Luc: Interesting.
So they don't use XML as language for the requests.
I would like to see their query language.
Aha, here is an example:

<p><quote>
The following example of X-Query syntax illustrates a request for a
doctor's details by patient name (for example, a patient is in trouble
and the nurse wants to contact the doctor):

<p><tt>...?_xql=hospital/patient[p-surname=\"Jones\"]/doctor</tt>

<p>where \"...\" stands for the address of the Tamino XML Server. This
query retrieves the record of the doctor associated with the patient
called \"Jones\". The user does not know that the patient's record is
stored in XML format and the doctor's details are retrieved from an
SQL table. In practice, the X-Query syntax is also hidden from the
user by an application GUI.

<p></quote>

<p><quote> The XML engine's basic function is to store XML objects in and
retrieve them from their respective data sources. It does this based
on schemas defined by the administrator in the Data Map. XML objects
are stored natively in Tamino.  (...)  XML objects to be stored by the
XML engine are described by their schema stored in Tamino's Data
Map. Tamino XML Server's built-in XML parser checks the syntactical
correctness of the schema and ensures that incoming XML objects are
well-formed.</quote>

<p>Luc: Lino uses the pure programming language (currently PHP) to define
the data map. If a system administrator wants to adapt the data
dictionary to her needs, she must do this in PHP. Why should XML be
better? One advantage: if a new Lino version decides to switch to
Java, they must all convert their data dictionaries... But...)
