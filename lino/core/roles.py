    Utility function to find out the reason of a TypeError "Cannot

        from one import A
        from two import B
        from three import C

        # A, B and C are subclasses of UserRole

        class MyUserRole(A, B, C):

    and Python tells you that it cannot create a consistent MRO.

    So somewhere in those classes A, B and C is a "duplicate"
    ancestor. And you have no idea where it is.
