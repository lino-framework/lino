class Plugin(object):
    """The base class for all plugin descriptors.

    For an introduction, see :doc:`/dev/plugins`.

    Plugin descriptors get defined and configured before Django models
    start to load.  Lino creates one :class:`Plugin` instance for
    every installed plugin and makes it globally available in
    :attr:`dd.plugins.FOO <lino.core.site.Site.plugins>` (where `FOO`
    is the `app_label` of the plugin).

    The :class:`Plugin` class is comparable to Django's `AppConfig
    <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/applications/>`_ class
    which has been added in version 1.7., but there is at least one
    important difference: in Lino the :class:`Plugin` instances for
    all installed plugins are available (in :attr:`dd.plugins
    <lino.core.site.Site.plugins>`) *before* Django starts to load the
    first :xfile:`models.py`.  This is possible because Plugins are
    defined in :xfile:`__init__.py` files of your plugins. As a
    consequence, unlike Django's `AppConfig`, you *cannot* define a
    `Plugin` in your :xfile:`models.py` file, you *must* define it in
    your plugins's :xfile:`__init__.py`.

    """

    """

    short_name = None
    """The abbreviated name of this plugin, shown to the user in places
    where shortness is important, e.g. as the label of the tabs of a
    detail layout.  This can be a lazily translated string. Defaults
    to :attr:`verbose_name`.

    additional plugin filter even after :meth:`get_apps_modifiers
    <lino.core.site.Site.get_apps_modifiers>`.

    The plugin names can be either the full name or just the
    app_label.

    This list is allowed to contain names of plugins which are not
    installed at all.

    Usage example: The :mod:`lino.modlib.tinymce` works only with
    ExtJS 3, and we currently believe that we will never need it in
    ExtJS 6.  When switching back and forth between
    :mod:`lino.modlib.extjs` and :mod:`lino_extjs6.extjs6`, we had to
    remove it explicitly by also defining a :meth:`get_apps_modifiers
    <lino.core.site.Site.get_apps_modifiers>` method::

        def get_apps_modifiers(self, **kw):
            kw = super(Site, self).get_apps_modifiers(**kw)
            kw.update(tinymce=None)
            return kw

    Now :mod:`lino_extjs6.extjs6` has :attr:`disables_plugins` set to
    ``['tinymce']`` and we no longer need above code because Lino now
    removes it automatically when ExtJS 6 is being used.
