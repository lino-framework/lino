"""This middleware is automatically being installed on every Lino
site.

When an exception occurs during an AJAX call, Lino should not respond
with Django's default HTML formatted error report but with a
plain-text traceback because that's more readable when seen in a
browser console.

Originally inspired by http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/650

Additions by LS:

- also logs a warning on the development server because that is easier
  to read than opening firebug and look at the response.

- must work also when :setting:`DEBUG` is False. Yes, on a production
  server it is not wise to publish the traceback, but our nice HTML
  formatted "Congratulations, you found a problem" page is never the
  right answer to an AJAX call.

- :func:`format_request` adds information about the incoming call,
  including POST or PUT data.
