"""The :mod:`lino.utils.ranges` module contains utility methods for
working with "ranges".

This docstring is part of the Lino test suite. To test only this
module, run::

  $ python setup.py test -s tests.UtilsTests.test_ranges

A range is basically a tuple of two values `a` and `b`, called also
limits, who indicate the start and the end of the range.

An open range is a range that has at least one limit set to `None`.

    This function is typically used with date values, but it also
    works with integers or other comparable values.  The following
    examples use integer values to be more readable.

    Unlike the test presented at
    <http://bytes.com/topic/python/answers/457949-determing-whether-two-ranges-overlap>,
    this works also with "open" ranges (the open end being indicated
