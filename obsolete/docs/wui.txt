Running Lino as a Web application
=================================

The Web User Interface (WUI) is the first UI for Lino to be
implemented.  This implementation is being done with a future support
for a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in mind.

To run as a Web Application, Lino currently uses Irmen de Jong's
Snakelets server.  This is a standalone HTTP server in pure Python.
Advantage of this aproach is that it is very easy to get a Lino
running on any machine.  Also is the Snakelets code simple and easy to
understand.

Server startup
--------------

Invoking the `snake/serve.py` script will start the Snakelets server.
The `snake/webapps`directory contains (besides those applications
coming with Snakelets) one application "Lino".
`snake/webapps/lino/__init__.py` will be run by the server, and it
does especially the starup of the adamo database.  The Database object
which acts as handler is then stored in the "application context"

Windows
-------

Windows are abstract descriptors of a web page to be displayed. A
Window contains Components.  Components are things as MenuBar, Label,
Table, EntryField, DataGrid, Button, ...

Windows and their Components are defined in
`lino/agui/widgets.py`. They are abstract enough to be usable for GUI
and WUI.  It is possible that these "Widgets" will be replaced by
anygui.

In a session there can be more than one Window at a time:

- the user can simply open another browser instance. All browser
  instances on the same maching share the same session.

- a window can get children.

Creating a non-modal child window corresponds to opening another
browser instance. Creating a modal child means that the parent window
stays in "background", waiting for the result of the child window.

The server and Lino
-------------------

All Lino Web pages are created by a single Snakelet (MainSnakelet)
who maintains a session-wide list of Window instances and does the
dispatching work of deciding which Window comes next.

The main responsibility of a snakelet is to write some HTML to the
response's output stream.  MainSnakelet does this task by deciding
which window must be rendered next, then creating a `SnakeUI` instance
and calling its `renderWindow()` to do the work.

The `UI` (user interface) class defines methods for communicating with
the user, again hiding the fact whether it is a WUI or a GUI or
any other UI.  In a Web application, UI.renderWindow() will write some
HTML to the response's output stream.  In a GUI application it will
open a Window on the users desktop. In a console UI it will display
some text to the console and wait for keyboard input. An E-Mail UI
would send an e-mail and wait for an answer...

Application code can never call renderWindow() directly and wait for
the answer (as is done by a old-fashioned GUI application when it
opens a modal window) but can only define windows to be displayed and
actions to be taken when the answer comes (call-back functions). Lino
asks the application code to build windows, but how and when they will
be rendered is transparent for the application. For example
`Database.getMainWindow()` must return a window which serves as main
entry point for this database. 

`ui` is a subclass of the abstract user interface class
`lino.agui.ui.UI`. `UI` defines the interface which is common for any
user interface. HtmlUI is a first (still abstract) subclass of UI that
contains methods to be used for any Web UI. SnakeUI finally is a
usable subclass of HtmlUI which really collaborates with snakeserver.

UI also provides some utility methods (`confirm()`, others to
come) which return a ready-made Window.


Callbacks
---------

Buttons and MenuItems are Components which can cause some application
logic to be executed.


Actions are functions or methods which can be invoked (for example if
a Button has been klicked).

`Actions` are "UI-aware methods": they will be called with a single
parameter "ui", and they must return a Window instance which will be
rendered as next window.  They can return None. Convention : usually
their name starts with `ui_`.
