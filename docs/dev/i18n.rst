Internationalization
====================

An introduction to translatable strings.

About this document
-------------------

This document is part of the Lino test suite. You can test only this
document by issuing::

  $ python setup.py test -s tests.DocsTests.test_i18n

Doctest initialization:

>>> from lino import startup
>>> startup('lino.projects.docs.settings.demo')
>>> from lino.api.shell import *

>>> from django.utils.translation import ugettext as _

If no language is activated, :func:`ugettext` just returns the English
text:

>>> _("January")
u'January'

In Lino we usually use the :func:`translation.override` context when
we want to translate:

>>> from django.utils import translation
>>> with translation.override('fr'):
...     _("January")
u'janvier'

How does the :func:`ugettext` function know that "January" is
"janvier" in French? See :command:`fab mm`.

Note that :func:`ugettext` will do the lookup in-place. The following
code prints English and not German:

>>> s = _("January")
>>> with translation.override('de'):
...     print(s)
January


>>> from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _
>>> s = _("January")
>>> with translation.override('de'):
...     print(unicode(s))
Januar

    
With Django until 1.6 we had a strange behaviour (but the following
snippet would fail in newer Django versions and therefore is not
tested anymore)::

    >> with translation.override('de'):
    ...     print(s)  #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <django.utils.functional.__proxy__ object at ...>
