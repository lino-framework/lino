During the week-end I probably found a suitable solution for the 
"possibility to show a previously uploaded file." 
Simply by clicking on the TextField (which is not editable).

TODO: 

- The same trick might be used for URLField (instead of a TwinTrigger)

- A request to `/api/` will sometimes return JSON, sometimes HTML.
  When an AJAX action expects JSON and gets a HTML 404 response, 
  the JSON parser may behave unexpectedly. 
  No ideas yet on how to optimize this...


Now there's still this problem:

- Lino.submit_detail uses POST instead of PUT 
  when submitting a form with `filesUpload=true`.
  
This is because file uploads work only with method POST. 
ExtJS accordingly forces a POST although I specify PUT.
Consequence: when modifying an existing upload 
there may not be any ``<input type="file">``!
So the "probably suitable solution" wasn't yet suitable...

FileFieldElement must generate a :js:class:`Lino.Filefield` 
when in an Insert form, and something similar to an URLField 
when in a Detail form. Currently there is only one LayoutHandle 
used for both detail and insert views. 
A FileFieldElement doesn't even know wheter it is in 
a Detail or in an Insert form.

The solution for this appearently hard problem was simple: the decision 
is done in :xfile`lino.js`::

  Lino.file_field_handler = function(ww,config) {
    if (ww instanceof Lino.DetailWrapper) {
        return new Lino.FileField(config);
    }else{
        ww.fileUpload = true;
        return new Ext.ux.form.FileUploadField(config);
    }
  }
