==================================

- Started new document :ref:`welfare.tour`.

- :mod:`lino.utils.actordoc` now supports :role:`ddref` referring to
  an *action*. 

  TODO: the action's label appears correctly but they are not yet
  clickable; if the action has an icon, insert this into the text.

- New Site-wide setting :setting:`use_java`.

- Thanks to Joe who contributed two changesets:

  - Simple change to allow HTML box to use some javascript. I use it
    for adding Ext.Resizer to textareas to allow dynamic resizing.

  - Changes required to make modlib changes working with CTMS project.
    They are hopefully self-explanatory enough.  The "Stylistic
    clean-up" makes lino/modlib/changes/models.py file pep8 happy.


- Fixed a minor bug in :mod:`atelier.rstgen`: 
  :meth:`Column.adjust_width <atelier.rstgen.Column.adjust_width>`
  did not call 
  :meth:`Table.format_value <atelier.rstgen.Table.format_value>`
  before comparing the required width. And in case of formatted values
  this lead to wrong width calculation.
