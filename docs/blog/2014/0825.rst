I started to split the `pcsw.Client` model into a "base" version and
an extended version for Eupen.

While I was there I slightly changed the the API for defining
overrideable library models using customizeable model abstractness:


- In :attr:`ad.Plugin.extends_models` the named models must not any
  more include the app_label. Until now you had to define::

    from lino.modlib.notes import Plugin
    class Plugin(Plugin):
        extends_models = ['notes.Note']
    
  Now yuo write::

    from lino.modlib.notes import Plugin
    class Plugin(Plugin):
        extends_models = ['Note']


- And then the :meth:`dd.is_abstract_model` has a new API. In the
  `Meta` class of a model which wants to be overrideable, you must
  replace

  ::

        abstract = dd.is_abstract_model('notes.Note')

  by::
        abstract = dd.is_abstract_model(__name__, 'Note')

The main reason for this change was a new feature: Lino now supports
multi-level plugin inheritance.  We could now define a `Person` class
in `lino_welfare.projects.chatelet.modlib.contacts` which inherits
from `lino_welfare.modlib.contacts` which in turn inherits from
`lino.modlib.contacts`.
