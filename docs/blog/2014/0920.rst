Two API changes
---------------

Oops, here is an API change which caused me some code changes. But I
think it was worth the work because it makes things *much* more clear.
And there is hope that other developers didn't yet use it very much
since it was not yet documented clearly:

I added a new module :mod:`lino.rt` and moved the following functions
and objects from :mod:`lino.dd` to it:

- :func:`rt.startup`
- :attr:`rt.modules`
- :func:`rt.login`
- :func:`rt.show`


And then I did another thing which had been waiting in my mind for
quite some time: 

- The objects stored in :attr:`rt.modules` are no longer
  :class:`AttrDict <atelier.utils.AttrDict>` instances but the
  :xfile:`models.py` modules themselves.

My general impression is that this makes Lino more beautiful because
it is "one strange thing less".

This change should officially not influence any code, but there
exceptions when it comes to hackerish usages.  For example certain
tested tutorial documents (like :ref:`dev.tables`) used a trick to put
the names of models and tables to the global namespace:

>>> from lino.runtime import *
>>> globals().update(tables)

This hack has become different: 

>>> from lino.runtime import *
>>> globals().update(tables.__dict__)



Remote fields failed on empty values
------------------------------------

I discovered a bug in :ref:`faggio`. After creating a new room, I got
the following console message, and the list of rooms no longer
appeared at all::

    [20/Sep/2014 20:20:44] "GET /api/cal/Rooms/-99999?_dc=1411233644184&an=insert&rp=ext-comp-2235&fmt=json HTTP/1.1" 200 426
    ERROR 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'city'
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/luc/hgwork/lino/lino/core/model.py", line 150, in func
        obj, ar)
      File "/home/luc/hgwork/lino/lino/ui/store.py", line 191, in full_value_from_object
        return getattr(obj, self.name)
    AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'city'
    WARNING AjaxExceptionResponse:
    AttributeError
    'str' object has no attribute 'pk'


Wrote a new test case to reproduce this: :ref:`faggio.tested.cal`.
The reason was a bug in :class:`lino.core.fields.RemoteField`
triggered by the `company__city` column in the :class:`ml.cal.Rooms`
list (but only the :ref:`faggio` variant of it.
