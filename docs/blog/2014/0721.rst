=====================

I removed the following permission test in the
:meth:`dd.Actor.parse_req` method of
:class:`ml.extensible.PanelEvents`::

    if not request.user.profile.authenticated:
        raise exceptions.PermissionDenied(
            _("As %s you have no permission to run this action.")
            % request.user.profile)

Because it is not the responsibility of this method to test this.
This exception occured rather often at :ref:`welcht` in some complex
conditions, probably when some application code instantiates itself a
request using :meth:`rt.ar.spawn` in order to generate
e.g. the clickable number of a :class:`dd.RequestField`.
