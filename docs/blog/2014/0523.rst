Final sprint before releasing of :ref:`welfare`
-----------------------------------------------

The data migration is rather complex this time. 
Most work is done in :mod:`lino_welfare.migrate`.

I moved a piece of old code from 
:mod:`migrate <lino_welfare.migrate>` to
:mod:`migrate_old <lino_welfare.migrate_old>`.

Interesting to not that migrations are (of course) cummulative. This
time I am doing a double migration in Eupen. Their production server
is at version 1.0.10, so we are using :meth:`migrate_from_1_0_10
<lino_welfare.migrate.Migrator.migrate_from_1_0_10>` and
:meth:`migrate_from_1_0_11
<lino_welfare.migrate.Migrator.migrate_from_1_0_11>` in a single run.


The :attr:`ml.reception.Clients.create_visit` action was not rendered
anymore.  This was due to the following automatism in
:class:`dd.Action` constructor (which I therefore removed again)::

    # if self.parameters is not None and self.select_rows:
    #     self.show_in_bbar = False
    #     # see ticket #105

Added explanations to :srcref:`docs/tickets/105`. 

The French translations are now more or less ready.

Moved more docstrings from miscellaneous source files to
:class:`lino.core.site.Site`.

The next young man discovered Lino and wants to learn it.
