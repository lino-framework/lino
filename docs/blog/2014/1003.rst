=======================

I rediscovered the ticket :doc:`/tickets/122`
and merged :doc:`/tickets/130` into it.

Started to prepare database migration for :ref:`dsbe`.

I decided to undo the following change (:blogref:`20140919`):

- :ref:`welfare` now sets the `person_model` for both 
  :attr:`humanlinks <ml.humanlinks.Plugin.person_model>` and
  :attr:`household <ml.households.Plugin.person_model>`
  to `pcsw.Client`. 

Because (1) this would cause lots of simple Persons to become Clients
in Eupen and (2) it is probably no longer necessary because we have now
the polymorphic navigator (:blogref:`20140920`).

:mod:`ml.households.SiblingsByPerson` now also in Eupen no longer uses
`slave_grid_format` "summary"

The ``std`` fixture for :mod:`welfare.aids` now adds a company
"Belgisches Rotes Kreuz", to have an example of a confirmation with
predefined recipient.
