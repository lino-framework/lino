sphinxcontrib-dailyblog
-----------------------

I created a new project `sphinxcontrib-dailyblog` 
which contains what was previously in ``atelier.sphinxconf``, 
plus the new :mod:`sphinxconf.dailyblog.refstothis` module.

A new project means a decision about the license. Sigh!

I only recently found a consensus with Joe that for Lino I want the
LGPL (see :doc:`/tickets/79`).  Now I went to look for instructions on
`how to apply the LGPL to my code
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto>`_.  Where I stumbled over the
article `Why you shouldn't use the Lesser GPL for your next library
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl>`_.

People who write proprietary software anyway won't use Sphinx to
document it, so :ref:`dog` can be GPL (and not LGPL).

namespace packages
------------------

:ref:`atelier` did not yet support Python namespace packages.

But something is still wrong::

    >>> import sphinxcontrib
    >>> dir(sphinxcontrib)
    ['__doc__', '__name__', '__path__']
    >>> import sphinxcontrib.dailyblog
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    ImportError: No module named dailyblog
    >>> import sphinxcontrib.taglist
    >>> import sphinxcontrib.dailyblog
    >>> dir(sphinxcontrib)
    ['__builtins__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__name__', '__path__', 'dailyblog', 'taglist']

I guess that the reason is that I installed 
`sphinxcontrib-newsfeed` and
`sphinxcontrib-taglist`
using a simple ``pip install``, but then I used 
``pip install -e``to install
`sphinxcontrib-dailyblog`.
Package namespaces have a problem when mixing released
and development packages of a same namespace.

To try whether this is true, I uninstall the two released modules::

    $ pip uninstall sphinxcontrib-newsfeed
    $ pip uninstall sphinxcontrib-taglist

Yes, this was (probably) necessary, but it did *not* solve the
following problem::

    >>> import pkg_resources
    >>> dist = pkg_resources.get_distribution('sphinxcontrib.dailyblog')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    DistributionNotFound: sphinxcontrib.dailyblog



After quite some fiddling I discovered that in fact I don't need
the `dist` attribute of an :class:`atelier.Project`, so I just 
removed that line.
