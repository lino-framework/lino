Continued to work on ticket :doc:`/tickets/124`.

I removed most "partner" information from the detail of a household. A
household (in :ref:`welfare`) is now mostly the list of its members.
MembersByHousehold now shows the extended fields (first_name,
birth_date etc).

When the `person` of a household membership is empty, then Lino now
watches the data fields (first_name, last_name, birth_date and gender)
and, when all these fields are filled, will automatically create a
client using this data and set the `person` field to this client.

When a household membership has been modified, Lino now checks whether
this membership leads to a parental human link and, if appropriate,
creates one.
