Some translations, and then upgrade with database migration in Eupen.

Bugfix: The :class:`lino.mixins.periods.PeriodEvents` choicelist
(moved out from isip recently) had no `app_label`. Which caused the
windows based on it to not open (and to write a JS error "Undefined
name 'Lino.mixins')."

Bugfix: The :class:`dd.MergeAction` worked but did not give correct
feedback (window remained open and caused an :ref:`ise`). But the
merge actually had been done.

Testing today
-------------

New method :meth:`ad.Site.today`.  This method was truly necessary!

Because there are more and more test cases for :ref:`welfare` which
test for subtle conditions that arise when generating automatic
calendar events. For example to not work on holidays, managing
conflicting events etc. And I think the best approch is to say once
for all that our demo database "lives" on a constant date. This date
happens to be `2014-05-22` because that was when I added the
:attr:`ad.Site.the_demo_date` attribute.

And today I finally understood that this wasn't enough. Many tables
used Python's :func:`datetime.date.today` function, causing the
results to vary depending on the day when the demo database had been
generated.  For example the ages of the family members of
:ref:`paulfrisch` changed -of course- each time one of them had had
birthday...

And imagine! The :ref:`welfare` test suite passes again!
