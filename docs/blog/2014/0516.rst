====================

I discovered that :class:`ml.excerpts.CreateExcerpt`, like every
:term:`dialog action`, cannot be in the top toolbar because these
actions must be statically renderable.

I discovered that Lino didn't yet support choosers on actions with a
parameter window.

- One problem was that :func:`lino.core.actions.check_for_chooser`
  failed when you defined a :meth:`dd.Action.FOO_choices` method on an
  action.

- Another problem was that
  `ExtRenderer.js_render_ActionFormPanelSubclass` did not generate a
  :js:func:`ActionFormPanel.before_row_edit` function (and that
  :js:func:`ActionFormPanel.set_field_values` did not call it).

I started to rename "attestations" to "excerpts". First the model
classes themselves. The module name will move in a separate commit.

The Lino test suite had a failure in
:mod:`lino.tutorials.mini.tests`. Added some test cases there.
