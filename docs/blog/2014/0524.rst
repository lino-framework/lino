======================

I noticed that the :attr:`ml.contacts.Plugin.hide_region` setting
didn't work. In fact I want to have this option activated in the
`online demo <http://demo4.lino-framework.org/>`__.

Added new function :func:`ad.configure_plugin`.
And :meth:`ad.Site.configure_plugin` now raises an exception.

Worked on the documentation in general. There's still much to do.
