The first Lino workshop in Vigala
---------------------------------

Manuel has arrived yesterday in Tallinn. He was the first to accept
our offer of getting a free Lino workshop. He will live for four days
in our house, and we are working together to get him started as a Lino
application developer.

During the next days I am likely to work on related sections of the
Lino documentation (mainly :doc:`/dev/install`)



- Fixed `AttributeError: work_root` in :ref:`atelier`
  occuring when there was no
  `work_root` in user's :xfile:`.fabricrc` file.  The `work_root` env
  setting is no longer used.
