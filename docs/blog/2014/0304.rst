=================================

I discovered an internal bug: the test suite below
:mod:`lino_welfare.tests` was inactive (not being discovered) Django
1.6 because test case discovery has changed. And my default
environment was 1.6 since quite some time. 


Cool! I solved the last (rather subtile) problems for reading eID
cards.  `BaseBeIdReadCardAction.goto_client_response` now calls
:meth:`ar.goto_instance
<lino.core.requests.BaseRequest.goto_instance>` instead of setting
`goto_record_id`. Because the latter works only when the action was
called from a detail window (but not when called from a grid or from
the home page).  `Kernel.get_callback` now sets `ar.renderer`, that's
needed if the action calls ar.

First unit tests in :mod:`lino_welfare.tests.test_beid`.
Most functionality is in :mod:`lino.modlib.beid.mixins`. 
Started to write user documentation in :ref:`welfare.beid`.

I had to replace `exclude_trees
<http://sphinx-doc.org/config.html#confval-exclude_trees>`_ by
`exclude_patterns
<http://sphinx-doc.org/config.html#confval-exclude_patterns>`_ in my
`conf.py` files. Seems that the deprecated option no longer works
correctly. (But I don't consider it necessary to report this to
sphinx-users.)

Continued on :mod:`lino.modlib.humanlinks`. Found a surprisingly
simple solution for one customer request: a different `insert_layout`
per slave table!
