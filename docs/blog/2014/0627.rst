Upgrade of :ref:`demos`
-----------------------

Before I can do an upgrade of the :ref:`demos` I have to close a
security hole: the :attr:`ml.excerpts.Excerpt.body_template_content`
field must be invisible even for administrators on these sites.  I had
to fight with some detail devils, but the basic approach was easy::

    davlink = dd.resolve_plugin('davlink')

    class ExcerptDetail(dd.FormLayout):
        main = "general config" if davlink else "general"
