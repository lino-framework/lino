Removed the `extends` attribute from Plugin
-------------------------------------------

Removed the `extends` attribute in :class:`Plugin
<djangosite.djangosite_site.Plugin>` because it was redundant information.
The Site now inspects each plugin's `__mro__`
attribute to get that information.

Moved the :meth:`Site.for_each_app <djangosite.djangosite_site.Site.for_each_app>` from :mod:`lino`  to :mod:`djangosite`.

An app which wants to be "subclassable" must now define a 
`Plugin` in her :file:`__init__.py` file.
IOW in order to inherit from a library app it thus is now necessary to 
define a Plugin class in the parent app. 

Added a testcase to :ref:`faggio` to test whether 
the templates directory has been inherited.

"modlib" or "apps"?
-------------------

I discovered that my plan to rename `lino.modlib` to `lino.apps` has
at least two disadvantages:

- possible misunderstanding that it has something to do with
  `django.apps`

- The string "modlib" was more or less unique while "apps" 
  is overused.

Maybe I'll change my mind and move the existing `lino.apps` modules
back to :mod:`lino.modlib`.
