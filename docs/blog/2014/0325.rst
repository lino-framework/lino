Uploads
-------

In :ref:`welfare` we would like to change a few things about the
"Uploads" of a client. An "upload", currently, represents an external
document (not generated by Lino) which the user has scanned,
downloaded or received by email and wants to store in the database.

One thing is that the user interface is rather quirky (ticket
:doc:`/tickets/102`, which probably will be easier to work on after
:doc:`/tickets/101`), but in general we agree that these two tickets
are not vitally urgent.

But one concrete user request is to also register information on
things like medical attestations about handicaps for which the user
has no original document, they just trust their client that it exists,
or they saw the original with their eyes but did not want to scan and
upload it. But they *do* want to get reminded when the validity of
that document expires.

My first idea is to simply add `blank=True` for the `FileField`
defined in the :class:`dd.Uploadable
<lino.mixins.uploadable.Uploadable>` mixin.  And also for the
`mimetype` field of course.

This turns :class:`lino.modlib.uploads.models.Upload` into something
more general than an "uploaded file". I'd call it a "managed external
document".

The uploads module was rather old. Now I converted it into a plugin 
and made it extendable. 
The :mod:`lino.modlib.uploads` is now minimalistic,
and only the new module :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.uploads` adds `valid_until`.


Study regimes
-------------

New class :class:`lino_welfare.modlib.isip.models.StudyRegimes`.  This
is to differenciate between "Studies" (Études) and "Trainings"
(Formations). The former might also be called "national" or "regular"
school system.

StudiesByPerson
TrainingsByPerson

Found also a document "Enseignement et Formation" by Patrice RANJARD 
which differentiates three levels of education:

- Enseignement (Teaching)  : changing representations, concepts
- Formation    (Training)  : changing practices, methods
- Thérapie     (Therapy)   : changing conducts, behaviour


Database migration:

- new field `study_regime` in :class:`lino_welfare.modlib.jobs.models.Study`


Human links
-----------

A `humanlinks.Link` no longer requires the child to be a registered client.



Checked in next morning although test suite of :ref:`welfare` is
certainly broken and the whole thing not yet stable.
