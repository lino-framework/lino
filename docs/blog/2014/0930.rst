Actions with parameters but without dialog
==========================================

Today I worked the whole day inside the actions framework to implement
the missing "detail" required to make :mod:`ml.polls` usable:

    Instead of "action calls with arbitrary arguments" we will
    probably do "actions with parameters but without window".
    Selecting a choice now works... except for the "detail" that it
    opens a window which the user must confirm.

There is no API change, but a new class attribute
:attr:`dd.Action.no_params_window`. 

Wrote a new tested document :ref:`tested.polly`.
