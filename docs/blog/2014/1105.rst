Updated :doc:`/dev/translate/index`.

A spontaneous experiment for :doc:`/tickets/66`: added a ``www``
setting for :ref:`noi`.  This is not yet working. The idea is to have
two wsgi scripts running on the same web server, one for authenticated
users with the admin interface, and another one for a simple read-only
web view of the visible data.

Trying to get rid of the PermissionDenied "As Anonyme you have no
permission to run this action" error emails. These are generated when
a user did not refresh their client after a dump-restore of the
database.

In order to test the new :meth:`isip.Contract.get_aid_type` method, I
needed to create an additional income Granting for each
:class:`welfare.isip.Contract`.

Adapted :ref:`welfare.excerpts.examples.de` because there are now 64
excerpts, too much to list them all.

The `ContractGrantingsByClient` table can definitvely go away.
