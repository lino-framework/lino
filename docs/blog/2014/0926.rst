==========================

Discovered and opened :srcref:`docs/tickets/128`.

While looking at this problem, I saw that simply adding a
:xfile:`models.py` module for :mod:`lino` with those choiceliss would
not be enough because Django's `loading.get_apps` method does not
return it when there is no model in it.  Installed apps without
models, but *with* choicelists, did not get their entry in
:attr:`rt.modules`. Until today. That's clearly odd.  I changed that
immediately (in :func:`rt.startup`) by replacing::

    for a in loading.get_apps():
        self.modules.define(a.__name__.split('.')[-2], a)

with::

    for p in self.installed_plugins:
        m = loading.load_app(p.app_name, False)
        self.modules.define(p.app_label, m)


I discovered why certain strings in :ref:`faggio` were not yet
translated: because I had switched :attr:`lino.core.site_def.Site.languages` of
:mod:`lino_faggio.projects.docs` to monolingual English.  If you do
that (have the demo database onl in English) but still support
multiple languages, then you must set `env.languages` in your
project's `fabfile.py`.

A test case failed (:mod:`lino.projects.min1.tests`) due to the recent
changes in :class:`ml.countries.EstonianAddressFormatter`.
