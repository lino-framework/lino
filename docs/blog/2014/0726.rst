Awesome uploader for Lino
-------------------------

I had another look at Andrew Rymarczyk's `AwesomeUploader
<http://jsjoy.com/blog/ext-js-extension-awesome-uploader>`_ and
started another exprimental integration into Lino. My first attempt
(`use_awesome_uploader`) is long time ago and Lino has evolved
meanwhile.

the base idea is that people can upload multiple files using drag and
drop, and then (later) open a list of their uploads where they can
"manage" them: assign them to a project, share them with others, ...

- New module :mod:`lino.modlib.awesomeuploader`.
- New action attribute :attr:`dd.Action.extjs_main_panel`, and
  `CalendarAction` is no longer defined in :mod:`lino.core` but in
  :mod:`lino.modlib.extensible` (Cool! If that remains the only
  result of today, then I am already happy!)


:ref:`noi` serves as guinea pig. 

Currently you must get the source code yourself from `google
<https://code.google.com/p/awesomeuploader>`_ and link it to your
project's media directory::

  $ cd repositories
  $ svn checkout http://awesomeuploader.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ awesomeuploader
  $ ln -s ~/repositories/awesomeuploader ~/myproject/media/awesomeuploader

But don't yet expect it to work. Because it doesn't. The menu command
and the quick link are there, but they only cause a TypeError
"this.main_item.config_containing_window is not a function".  That's
normal because I stopped there to make a checkin and have breakfast.
