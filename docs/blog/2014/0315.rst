- :doc:`/tickets/100`

- Fixed a bug in :mod:`atelier.sphinxconf`: The
  :directive:`tickets_table` was not able to handle documents with
  backticks (``\```) in the title.

- Also added `scripts/shotwell2blog.py` to the :ref:`atelier`
  repository. In fact it has not really to do with atelier, but I
  didn't want to create a project just for this.




Change in :ref:`site`: the :setting:`hidden_apps` setting was not
enough. I replaced it by :setting:`get_apps_modifiers`.

The week in Chatelet taught me that we will probably have many
variants of Lino Welfare.  I renamed :mod:`lino_welfare.settings.fr`
to :mod:`lino_welfare.settings.chatelet`, created a new package
:mod:`lino_welfare.settings.eupen`, started a new module
:mod:`lino.settings.base` which is common base for eupen and chatelet.

Note that the names *eupen* and *chatelet* don't mean that *every* new
site will get it's own package. `eupen` means rather "as they work in
Eupen" (and `chatelet` means "as they work in Chatelet").
