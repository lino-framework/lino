==================================

Worked on :doc:`/tickets/84`.

- New module :mod:`lino.modlib.lists`. `lists.List` is a list of 
  Partners (or a list of :class:`ContactRelated 
  <lino.modlib.contacts.models.ContactRelated>` to be precise).

  :ref:`faggio` is the first application. Seems to work. 
  TODO: adapt test cases
 

- "Groups" or "Organisations"? I decided to change the label of the
  `contacts.Company` model once more: from "Group" to "Organization".
  And it seems that "Organization" has won over "Organisation",
  despite what I believed when I wrote :doc:`/tickets/72`.

  That new (and hopefully last) change is because I seem to have
  decided now that a List itself is **not** also a Partner. It is
  **not** as in certain email clients where you can specify the name
  of a list as a recipient of a mail.  Sending mails to all the
  members of a `lists.List` will be an explicit action.
