====================================

New ideas on :doc:`/tickets/79`.  
Moved a miscellaneous question from
:doc:`/tickets/16` into a new ticket :doc:`/tickets/91`.  I plan to
update the *documentation* before actually switching to the LGPL. The
actual switching is a routine work and comes as the last and
"official" step. Before this I'd like to have clear and documented
interpretation.

One thing is to surf about it:

- `Using Python module on LGPL license in commercial product
  <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8580223/using-python-module-on-lgpl-license-in-commercial-product>`_

- `The LGPL and Java
  <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-java.en.html>`_

Another thing is to *think* about it (or to write down thoughts):

I imagine you are a Python programmer and want to write some
commercial software package, and you want to use Lino as a framework.
Concretely you will write Python code which imports things from
Lino. **That's okay and that's what I wanted to make possible by
switching from GPL to LGPL.**

The LGPL (unlike the BSD) then says that you may *not* make a copy of
Lino *itself* or any part of it and turn it into proprietary software.

Let's imagine for example that you don't use Lino but stumble over my
:ref:`lino.tutorial.human` tutorial and want to use this in a
proprietary plain Django application.  You can't do that directly
because it requires the :class:`ChoiceList
<lino.core.choicelists.ChoiceList>` class, an integral part of
Lino. You then start to work many hours, and because you are clever,
you manage to reimplement the :class:`ChoiceList
<lino.core.choicelists.ChoiceList>` concept without requiring Lino,
you have rewritten a new and better implementation of my
:mod:`lino.mixins.human` module.

And now you want to use this in a proprietary package? I say "Sorry,
but you will need to prove that you did *not* copy any part of Lino.
And that's rather utopic because *of course* (every Python programmer
can confirm it) you have been looking at my source code, and *of
course* you have been copying parts of it."  You may hide your deed by
changing variable names, reorganizing or obfuscating your code and so
on, but I (or rather some of my successors, because I personally don't
imagine that I would waste my time with this kind of activity) might
discover your product and suspect you of the above and try to prove
that you did so.  So don't do that if you are a professional. **Don't
copy LPGL licensed code into your proprietary product.**

Possible questions:

- But where is the limit between these two usages?  Aren't the example
  files and tutorials a part of Lino, too?  

  That's why example files don't have an LGPL copyright header. The
  lack of a copyright header indicates that that you may copy it and
  base even non-free work on it.

- But for example the :ref:`lino.tutorial.dpy` tutorial invites me to
  have a look at and get inspired by certain fixture files, and these
  files *do* have a copyright header.  

  In general one can say: as long as your proprietary application
  *uses* Lino, there's no danger. The dangerous thing is to *not* use
  Lino but to offer some proprietary product which looks suspiciously
  similar to Lino.


First logos for Lino
--------------------

Ta-daa! Ly finally took a few hours and crystallized our thoughts
about a logo for Lino (:doc:`/tickets/94`)
into something visible. Here a series of four
working drafts:

.. image:: 20140118b.png

.. image:: 20140118c.png

.. image:: 20140118d.png


The logo represents a tree, but also reminds a diagram with linked
objects.

Lino applications live, they grow slowly, they are long-term
investments into a sustainable system.

Comments are welcome.

My current favourite is b (that's why it is already visible in the
sidebar).


Sphinx tools for writing language courses
-----------------------------------------

After a meeting with Jorma Ihalainen, I created a ticket on
:doc:`/tickets/92`. This will have to wait at least until february.
