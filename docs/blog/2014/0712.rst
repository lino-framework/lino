=======================

I upgraded :ref:`eiche`, the last production site which was still
running with a version from before April 2014.


:class:`welfare.aids.Aid` is no longer called "Aid" but "Aid
confirmation".  It no longer inherits from
:class:`ml.boards.BoardDecision` (which removes the fields `board` and
`decided_date`).  Added :class:new field `remark`. Adapted the default
body template used to print an excerpt for an aid confirmation.
Increased application version from 1.1.13 to 1.1.14 since we need a
database migration. Wrote
:meth:`lino_welfare.migrate.Migrator.migrate_from_1_1_14`.
