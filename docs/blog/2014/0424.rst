========================

Fixed a bug which had been introduced together with the customizable
insert actions: pressing ENTER in a Detail window (or closing a dirty
Detail window and answering Yes when asked whether you want to save
your modifications) caused an :ref:`ise` because the AJAX call used
the wrong action name.

Tss, tss, how blind a man can be: why did I define the specialized
SubmitInsert action in :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.pcsw`? It can of
course be in :mod:`lino.modlib.dedupe`, together with `SimilarPersons`
itself! Everything in one place and no need to do anything special in
order to activate the app. Cool!
