============================

Cool: I finally fixed a bug in `linoweb.js` which has caused already
quite some irritation: Lino.HtmlBoxPanels failed to automatically
refresh after certain actions.  The reason was:
:meth:`Lino.FormPanel.get_status` must not store the whole
`data_record` (only the `record_id`) because that would prevent the
form from actually reloading when :meth:`set_status` is called after a
child window closed.


Opened ticket :doc:`/tickets/125`.
... and in the evening also did it for Lino and :ref:`welfare`.

The Emacs manual explains who to do a `replace operation across more
than one file
<http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/efaq/Replacing-text-across-multiple-files.html>`_. Summary:

- `M-x find-name-dired` to assemble a list of files
- `t` (toggle selection)
- `Q` to start a `query-replace-regexp` session on the selected files
- `Y` to accept all replacements in all files.


:doc:`/tickets/124`
-------------------

Continued to work on :doc:`/tickets/124`.

- Added a clickable checkbox indicating the primary household in 
  the summary view of :class:`ml.households.MembersByPerson`.

- :attr:`ml.cal.Event.user` : `verbose_name` is now "Agent" instead of
  "Responsible user"


:mod:`ml.reception` now adds two new states "excused" and "absent" to
:class:`ml.cal.GuestStates`.

Added :attr:`dd.AbstractTable.variable_row_height` to
:class:`ml.reception.AppointmentsByPartner`.
Before and after:

.. image:: 0918a.png
    :scale: 90

.. image:: 0918b.png
    :scale: 90

(Also tried whether it makes a difference when in :file:`lino.css` I
change the `white-space` property of `lino-auto-height` class from
``normal`` to ``wrap``.)


The :mod:`lino_welfare.projects.chatelet` variant now has a completely
redesigned :mod:`welfare.cv` module (currently in
:mod:`lino_welfare.projects.chatelet.modlib.cv`).  It is functionally
almost equivalent to :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.cv` which I plan to
deprecate since it uses :mod:`lino.modlib.properties`.

22:50

- I moved `HowWell` and `DoYouLike` from :mod:`lino.dd` back to
  `properties`, because I don't want these choicelists in the global
  :mod:`dd` module.

  This also has the advantage that I don't need a conversion during data
  migration (remember that `properties` stores their `app_label`).

  And then I use their copy in the new 
  :mod:`lino_welfare.projects.chatelet.modlib.cv` module.

- A DummyField is now a FakeField and may be used to explicitly ignore
  its name in a layout specification.  This subtle new feature is
  used by chatelet's `cv` app to solve the fact that
  `SiteConfig.detail_layout` contains three fields `propgroup_skills`,
  `propgroup_softskills` and `propgroup_obstacles` which are needed in
  eupen but not in chatelet. Declaring them as a `DummyField`
