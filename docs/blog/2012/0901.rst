Continued on lino.apps.presto


- Added new format URL_FORMAT_PLAIN.
  Not finished. But the proof of concept is promising.
  This is currently hidden behind the [html] button which 
  now calls URL_FORMAT_PLAIN instead of URL_FORMAT_PRINTER.
  Note that URL_FORMAT_PRINTER is still being used for '
  when slave_format='html'.
  
- Added fields birth_date and age to the Persons detail.
  
- Discovered a bug which had pass undiscovered until now: 
  The `total_inc` field 
  of :class:`lino.modlib.vat.models.VatDocument`
  caused an "Ajax communication failed" error when the user 
  tried to save an Invoice::
  
    TRACEBACK:

      File "t:\hgwork\lino\lino\core\fields.py", line 255, in set_value_in_object
        raise NotImplementedError

  This field is declared as a virtual PriceField::
  
    @dd.virtualfield(dd.PriceField(_("Total incl. VAT")))
    def total_incl(self,ar=None):
        if self.total_excl is None:
            return None
        return self.total_excl + self.total_vat
        
  Explanation: the `field` of a VirtStoreField was `editable`. 
  :class:`lino.core.fields.VirtualField`
  now does `return_type.editable = False`.
  
- Another aspect of the previous problem was that the `total_inc` 
  field, though it is 
  `readonly`, didn't not have the `x-item-disabled` class, as does 
  the `id` field of the same form::

    <input type="text" size="20" autocomplete="off" id="ext-comp-1155" name="id" 
    class="x-form-text x-form-field x-form-num-field x-item-disabled" 
    style="width: 28px; " disabled="">
    ...
    <input type="text" size="20" autocomplete="off" id="ext-comp-1239" name="total_incl" 
    class="x-form-text x-form-field x-form-num-field" readonly="" 
    style="width: 221px; ">  
    
  Seems that there is a bug in ExtJS (3.3.1): doesn't set
  the `x-item-disabled` class when 'disabled' is in the original config. 
  Only when dynamically setting it afterwards.
  
  Workaround: virtual fields are now also being added to the 
  dictionary returned by `DisabledFieldsStoreField`. 
    
- (Added some songs to :mod:`lino.modlib.vocbook.fr4et`)
