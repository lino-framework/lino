DiffingMixin replaced by :mod:`lino.core.changes`
-------------------------------------------------

If an application wanted database changes to be logged,
it had to subclass DiffingMixin when declaring a Model.

This approach was used by 
:class:`lino.modlib.notes.models.Note`,
:class:`lino_welfare.modlib.pcsw.models.Partner`
and
:class:`lino_welfare.modlib.isip.models.ContractBase`.

It had certain disadvantages and limits: 
no hook to locally change the rules, 
it didn't allow to watch only the changes to certain fields,
the user couldn't easily see the history of changes to a given object.

That's why we now have the new module :mod:`lino.core.changes`
which replaces :mod:`lino.utils.dblogger`.

Instead of inheriting from DiffingMixin, 
application programmers now define an
:meth:`on_site_startup <lino.Lino.on_site_startup>`
method for their :class:`lino.Lino`
where they call 
:meth:`watch_changes <lino.core.model.Model.watch_changes>`.

--------------------

There's still much to do.
