Workflows
---------

After reading the
`Introduction to Plone workflows
<http://plone.org/documentation/kb/creating-workflows-in-plone/introduction>`_
I started to think about how to implement workflows in Lino.

There would be a new :class:`lino.models.Rule` 
model and corresponding tables (`Rules`, 
`RulesByActor`,...). 
A Rule represents a possibility to get permission to 
execute a given action of a given actor.
The model would have the following fields:
  
- actor (CharField) : the actor
- action (CharField) : the action
- state (CharField,blank=True) with state_choices
- groups (CharField,blank=True) : 
  a space-separated list of required user groups (same meaning as
  :attr:`lino.core.actors.Actor.required_user_groups`)
- user_level : required user level
  :attr:`lino.core.actors.Actor.required_user_level` .

It is a "system" model (defined in :mod:`lino.models`).
If ever it turns out that we need a hook to select between 
different implementations for defining rules, we could 
move it to a separate module `lino.modlib.workflows`.

:class:`lino.core.actors.Actor` would get a new class variable 
`state_field` which, if not `None`, would be the name of 
a field which must be defined on the Actor's model and which must 
have a list of choices (either a hard-coded choicelist or 
a by being a ForeignKey).
Only actors with a `state_field` can have Rules.

:class:`lino.core.actions.Action` would get a new attribute 
`ruled`, a boolean that says whether or not permission on 
this action is governed by Rules or not.
If an action is not `ruled`, Lino will not consult 
the `Rules` table.
