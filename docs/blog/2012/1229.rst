========

Worked on :doc:`/tickets/67`.

- New view :class:`lino.ui.extjs3.views.PlainIndex`

- The detail of a row now renders something. This needs lots of fine-tuning, 
  but for a proof of concept that's enough now.

- :meth:`lino.ui.base.UI.get_patterns` now adds a single pattern instead 
  of one pattern for each `pages.Page`.
  
- Changed `admin_url` to :attr:`lino.Lino.admin_prefix`.

TODO: The ADMIN_URL variable in linolib.js doesn't 
correctly handle the case of an empty adin_prefix.
