Django and lxml
---------------

Yesterday evening already, after the changes on migrate were finished 
and a full dump from a 1.4.3 database sucessfully loaded into 1.4.4, 
I noticed that I couldn't see the result because the server process 
locked when a web request cam in.

Today it continued to lock.

I fiddled with the Apache configuration.
After 4 hours I believed that the following was the cause of the problem:

One of the first steps when a Django process starts up is to 
instantiate once each of the classes listed in 
:setting:`MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`. 
At that moment it is "not yet allowed" to trigger 
`django.db.models.loading.cache._populate()`.
But :mod:`lino.utils.auth` 
(where :class:`RemoteUserMiddleware <lino.utils.auth.RemoteUserMiddleware>` 
is defined) did exactly this. 
It called, at the module level,
:func:`lino.tools.resolve_model` on the 
:attr:`lino.Lino.user_model`.

But it turned out that this was just another detail which didn't 
lead to a normal error message because of the freeze.

Using ``print`` statements I tracked down that the following code 
in :mod:`lino.utils.xmlgen` caused the freeze::

        if self.xsd_filename:
            self.xsd_tree = etree.parse(self.xsd_filename) 
        if self.xsd_tree is not None:
            if targetNamespace is None:
                root = self.xsd_tree.getroot()
                targetNamespace = str(root.get('targetNamespace'))
            if validator is None:
                validator = etree.XMLSchema(self.xsd_tree)  # LOCK

The process never returned when trying to instantiate 
an `etree.XMLSchema`.

After 8 hours I found the following post, which finally explains
into what mousetrap I had stepped:
`Django, lxml, WSGI, and Python sub-interpreter magic

(posted Fri, 07/30/2010 - 18:21 by branker).

The reason for the freeze was an incompatibility between mod_wsgi and lxml,
and the solution was indeed to add a line ``WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}`` 
to Apache's configuration. More explanations
