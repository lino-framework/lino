========

Oops, it's Friday and I didn't blog for a whole week...
And next week I won't be able to work very much because 
we're going to Saaremaa for holiday.

But after having worked about 40 hours on the Qooxdoo 
interface for Lino I can say:

- Sorry, but I'm not yet far enough to show results.
- But Qooxdoo is great, probably better than ExtJS, 
  so I'll continue. 
- It is the right time for taking the challenge
  of writing a second user interface for Lino.
  
Concretely:  

- The new `makeui` command works well. 
  I'll document that later.
  It generates local Qooxdoo source files, then runs 
  Qooxdoo's `generate build` on them.
  This takes only 30 seconds, 
  so :doc:`/tickets/30` is less urgent.
  
- Concretely I'm currently hoping for help from the 
  Qooxdoo forum:
  `Qooxdoo Table remains empty
  <http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=27221846>`_

- When the "empty Table" problem 
  is solved, I'll first write the Detail forms. 
  Because that's the last big challenge.
