Updated release 1.2.3
---------------------

Another set of small changes that enter into the 1.2.3 release:

- :attr:`lino.modlib.jobs.models.Candidature.job` was nullable, 
  which caused an 
  `AttributeError 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'name'` in 
  :meth:`lino.modlib.jobs.models.Candidature.__unicode__`
  when a user tried to save a Candidatur without a Job specified.
  
- There was no column `date_submitted` in the `CandidatursByPerson` 
  grid.
  This was because 
  :attr:`lino.apps.jobs.models.CandidatursByPerson.date_submitted` was 
  declared with `auto_now_add=True` 
  which makes it readonly, 
  and because a ``*`` in 
  :attr:`lino.reports.Report.column_names` does not expand to readonly fields.
