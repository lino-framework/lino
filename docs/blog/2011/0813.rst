========

Still exploring the ideas that came when writing the tutorial. 
:mod:`lino.tutorials.t2` now works with 
either `urls` (Lino on top; this is equivalent to not setting 
:setting:`ROOT_URLCONF` at all) 
or `urls2` (Lino under `/lino`).

:mod:`lino.tutorials.t2.urls3` shows how it is 
theoretically possible to install both Django's admin 
*and* Lino in parallel. 
But the details are left for those who are interested; 
Basically you just need to uncomment the related lines below.
But this tutorial still gets an ImproperlyConfigured error 
"Put 'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth' in 
your TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS setting in order to 
use the admin application."

.. todo::

  Tutorial 1 needs better explanations on 
  how to install the media tree.
  We need to write the text for tutorial 2...
