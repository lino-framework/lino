Repairing iGen
--------------


:mod:`lino.apps.igen` was broken after :doc:`/tickets/48`.
Started to repair it.

Added `related_name` 
to :attr:`lino.mixins.AutoUser.user` to avoid name clashes in 
:class:`lino.modlib.sales.models.SalesDocument`

New function :func:`lino.tools.makedirs_if_missing`.

Noted new ticket :doc:`/tickets/49`.

Check-in 20110902.


Solved some problems with docs.

Check-in 20110902b.
