========

(a) Labels in :xfile:`.dtl` files didn't get translated
-------------------------------------------------------

The following subtile i18n problem was due to a nice little bug:

#.  Reitertitel "Contracts" ("Verträge") im Detail Person ist noch nicht übersetzt.

To have the labels in :xfile:`.dtl` files translated, 
we must write dummy message files for them. 
This is done by running 
``make makedocs`` before running `´make mm``
in the root of Lino source repository.

But :meth:`lino.utils.config.Configured.make_dummy_messages_file`
somehow decided to not write the :xfile:`.dtl.py` file, 
thinking it were in a local directory.

That behaviour is basically correct since
making dummy messages in a local directory makes no sense 
(``make makedocs`` is to be used only by 
application developers).

The bug was that in this special case, 
:attr:`lino.Lino.project_dir` and
:attr:`lino.Lino.source_dir` are the same.
The :file:`lino/apps/xxx/config` dirs were 
loaded twice during :mod:`lino.utils.config` import, 
one "local" version and one "source" version. 

(b) Showing the MTI child
-------------------------

Cool: 
the label of a :class:`lino.utils.mti.EnableChild` 
field contains a "show" 
link, which wasn't implemented so far. 
Now it is: clicking on it will open the Detail window of that child.

The implementation uses a global JS variable ´Lino.current_window`. 
Not sure how this behaves in special circumstances...
