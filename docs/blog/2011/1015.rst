========

- The "quick search" box and the "csv" button in the top toolbar 
  of a Detail window
  are replaced by a `record_selector` combobox that allows 
  to select a record of this report.
  Note that the `record_selector` changes to empty as soon as a record 
  has been loaded.
  
- When specifying the action in the specifier for :meth:`lino.utils.menus.MenuItem.add_item`, the label was duplicated.

- quick links are no longer defined in :xfile:`welcome.html`. 
  This was a quite ugly system, and it allowed only links to the default action of a report.
  Now they are defined in :xfile:`settings.py` by overriding the new method 
  :meth:`lino.Lino.setup_quicklinks`.

- The Detail window of a report can now be invoked directly without 
  any record selected. 
  The form fields and the bottom toolbar are disabled in that case.
  
- Added Detail definition for `users.User`.
