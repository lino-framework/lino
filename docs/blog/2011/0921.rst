Worked on :doc:`/tickets/45`.


global name 'country' is not defined
------------------------------------

Fixed a bug in :attr:`lino.modlib.countries.models.CountryCity.create_city_choice` 
that caused a traceback on the server when Lino wanted to say 
"Refused to auto-create city %r in %s because same name exists."
