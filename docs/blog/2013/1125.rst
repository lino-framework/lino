===================================

Continued to move to GitHub
---------------------------

Moved also :ref:`atelier`, :ref:`site` and :ref:`north` to GitHub.

- Created a new repository "atelier" on github,
  this time without the 
  "Initialize this repository with a README"
  option checked.

- ::

      $ cd ~/hgwork
      $ deactivate 
      $ mv atelier atelier.hg
      $ git init atelier
      $ cd atelier
      $ ../fast-export/hg-fast-export.sh -r ~/hgwork/atelier.hg
      $ git checkout HEAD
      $ git remote add origin git@github.com:lsaffre/atelier.git
      $ git push --mirror https://github.com/lsaffre/atelier.git



      $ git mv README.txt README.rst
      $ git mv .hgignore .gitignore
      $ . ~/pythonenvs/py27/bin/activate
      $ echo 'env.use_mercurial = False' >> fabfile.py
      $ fab ci

- Adapted
  :file:`links.html`
  and
  :file:`layout.html`
  in :file:`docs/.templates`
  to link to GitHub instead of Google Code.

Repeated the above for *atelier*, *djangosite* and *north*.

Some notes:

- The commit message generated by :fab:`ci` now points to the 
  "real" blog entry at `docs.lino-framework.org/blog/yyyy/mmdd.html`, 
  no longer to the source `.rst` file.
  It builds the address using the `intersphinx_url` attribute of
  `env.blogger_project`.

  Note that my self-designed "blogging system" is open to
  discussion and critics.  
  It works for me, but I never had feedback from other
  developers about it.
  Since I have always been working as an independant developer, 
  my workflows differ from those of a team project.
  Atelier tries to build a bridge between the systems.
  The basic difference is that I don't always 
  want to select or create a ticket before starting to do changes.

- The `git remote <http://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote>`_
  commands are use to manage the "set of tracked repositories"
  attached to this.

Once I mistakenly `push --mirror`ed the *djangosite* repository 
to *atelier*. Github accepted this. Result was that 
https://github.com/lsaffre/atelier
then showed the same content as 
https://github.com/lsaffre/djangosite.
I "repaired" that by doing another 
`git push --mirror` from my *atelier* repository.
The reference documentation explains 
`git push --mirror <http://git-scm.com/docs/git-push>`_
as follows:

  "Instead of naming each ref to push, specifies that all refs under
  refs/ (which includes but is not limited to refs/heads/,
  refs/remotes/, and refs/tags/) be mirrored to the remote
  repository. Newly created local refs will be pushed to the remote
  end, locally updated refs will be force updated on the remote end,
  and deleted refs will be removed from the remote end. This is the
  default if the configuration option remote.<remote>.mirror is set.

I don't understand nothing of the above sentence and instead 
believe that 
`git push --mirror`
simply means "make remote repository forget everything and 
install content of this one there".


Fixed some minor problems in cities demo data
---------------------------------------------

After the move I re-ren the test suites and discovered 
dome problems like the following::

  MultipleObjectsReturned: Problem installing fixture '/home/luc/hgwork/lino/lino/modlib/statbel/fixtures/inscodes.py': get() returned more than one City -- it returned 2! Lookup parameters were {'country': <Country: Belgien>, 'name': u'Bl\xe9gny', 'zip_code': u'4670'}

I guess that they came in when I added the 
:mod:`lino.modlib.countries.fixture.demo` fixture.
Didn't notice until now because I didn't run :fab:`initdb` 
after this.


Making my code PEP8-compliant
-----------------------------

Joe wrote: 

    I've read your blog post about PEP8 and for example the missing
    spaces after parameters are for my eyes such a pain to look
    at. Maybe it's just about habits, but that's why I find the fact
    that all the python code i standardized so great - almost all
    python code is so easy to read.

    Would you accept a big pull-request changing for example the whole
    Lino.core to PEP8 compliant?

Yes I accept and am now waiting for Joe's first "serious" contribution 
to the :mod:`lino.core`.

Out of curiosity I also installed 
`autopep8 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/autopep8/>`_
and had it run over :ref:`atelier`, :ref:`site` and :ref:`north` 
using::

  $ autopep8 -ir atelier 

Works like a charm.
