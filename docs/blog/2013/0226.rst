- Added method :meth:`lino.modlib.users.models.User.get_by_username`.

- Added more tests to 
  :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.pcsw.tests.watchtim_tests`.

- Official sdist and upload to PyPI for
  :doc:`Lino </releases/1.5.12>` and  :welfare:`Lino-Welfare </releases/1.0.15>`


Which Python installer to use
-----------------------------

Yet another move inspired by 
`Two scoops of Django <https://django.2scoops.org/>`_
(see also :doc:`/tickets/72`) 
is to start using pip-installer and virtualenv.

In the
`Differences between distribute, distutils, setuptools and distutils2?
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6344076>`__
post on Stackoverflow,
Flimm writes rather clearly:

  Here's a summary of the Python packaging landscape in February 2013:
  
  (...)

  **Distribute** is a fork of Setuptools. It shares the same namespace, so if you have Distribute installed, import setuptools actually imports the package distributed with Distribute. It also includes an easy_install command-line tool, but it was designed to work well with Pip, which replaces it.
  It is also designed to work well with Python 2 or 3 or both. The latest version was released on 31 December 2012, so I would consider it alive and kicking. **At the time of writing, I recommend this tool over other tools.**

  (...)
  
  So in conclusion, out of all these options, **I would recommend Distribute**, unless your requirements are very basic and you only need Distutils. Distribute works very well with Virtualenv and Pip, tools that I highly recommend.

I'm still just a little bit confused about the relation between 
pip-installer and python-distribute.

As a first step I removed all Pythons from my computer and started from scratch.

Download Python 2.7.3 (for the moment I am not yet interested in Python 3)

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute says: 
"distribute_setup.py is the simplest and preferred way on all systems."
So I downloaded `distribute_setup.py <http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py>`__
and execute it using "the Python interpreter of my choice"::

    c:\temp> python distribute_setup.py
    Downloading http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/d/distribute/distribute-0.6.35.tar.gz
    Extracting in c:\docume~1\luc\locals~1\temp\tmpxopjyi
    Now working in c:\docume~1\luc\locals~1\temp\tmpxopjyi\distribute-0.6.35
    Installing Distribute
    ...
    creating build\bdist.win32\egg\EGG-INFO
    copying distribute.egg-info\PKG-INFO -> build\bdist.win32\egg\EGG-INFO
    copying distribute.egg-info\SOURCES.txt -> build\bdist.win32\egg\EGG-INFO
    copying distribute.egg-info\dependency_links.txt -> build\bdist.win32\egg\EGG-INFO
    copying distribute.egg-info\entry_points.txt -> build\bdist.win32\egg\EGG-INFO
    copying distribute.egg-info\top_level.txt -> build\bdist.win32\egg\EGG-INFO
    copying distribute.egg-info\zip-safe -> build\bdist.win32\egg\EGG-INFO
    creating dist
    creating 'dist\distribute-0.6.35-py2.7.egg' and adding 'build\bdist.win32\egg' to it
    removing 'build\bdist.win32\egg' (and everything under it)
    Processing distribute-0.6.35-py2.7.egg
    creating c:\python27\lib\site-packages\distribute-0.6.35-py2.7.egg
    Extracting distribute-0.6.35-py2.7.egg to c:\python27\lib\site-packages
    Adding distribute 0.6.35 to easy-install.pth file
    Installing easy_install-script.py script to c:\Python27\Scripts
    Installing easy_install.exe script to c:\Python27\Scripts
    Installing easy_install-2.7-script.py script to c:\Python27\Scripts
    Installing easy_install-2.7.exe script to c:\Python27\Scripts

    Installed c:\python27\lib\site-packages\distribute-0.6.35-py2.7.egg
    Processing dependencies for distribute==0.6.35
    Finished processing dependencies for distribute==0.6.35
    After install bootstrap.
    Creating c:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\setuptools-0.6c11-py2.7.egg-info
    Creating c:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\setuptools.pth

Next step is unclear : pip first or virtualenv first?
I chose "pip first"::
  
    c:\temp\> curl -O https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py
    c:\temp\> python get-pip.py
    Downloading/unpacking pip

    Cleaning up...

After reading more about virtualenv I decided to not yet install it.

Removed my `sitecustomize.py` from my PYTHONPATH which until now was my 
self-made package installer.

For my own projects I need pip's ``-e`` switch::

    C:\temp>pip install -e t:\hgwork\lino
    Obtaining file:///t%7C%5Chgwork%5Clino
      Running setup.py egg_info for package from file:///t%7C%5Chgwork%5Clino

    Installing collected packages: lino
      Running setup.py develop for lino

        Creating c:\python27\lib\site-packages\lino.egg-link (link to .)
        Adding lino 1.5.12 to easy-install.pth file

        Installed t:\hgwork\lino
    Successfully installed lino
    Cleaning up...
    
Seems that installaing with the ``-e`` switch does not automatically 
install dependencies::

    C:\temp>python
    Python 2.7.3 (default, Apr 10 2012, 23:31:26) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> import lino
    Traceback (most recent call last):

        from dateutil import parser as dateparser
    ImportError: No module named dateutil
    
It's logical that I have to install them manually::

Note: `lxml` needs some C compiler, and since I don't have one 
I cannot install it easily using pip (as it seems).
But since Lino currently no longer needs lxml, I'm leaving that for later.
Just had to adapt some modules below :mod:`lino.utils.xmlgen` 
so that autodoc can continue to document 
them if lxml isn't installed.
