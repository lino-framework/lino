:mod:`atelier.fablib` : The `checkin` command now checks whether a 
blog entry exists after displaying `hg st` and asking whether to 
checkin. The advantage is that I can now run "pp ci" just to 
see the `hg st` of each project. As long as I answer "n" to the 
confirmations everybody is happy.

bug fixed:
:menuselection: `Site --> About` didn't display
the application's version.
Removed the `welcome_html` method from :class:`lino.ui.Site` as is 
was no longer used.

:menuselection: `Site --> About` now also shows the sourcecode 
timestamps for django, atelier, djangosite and north.
