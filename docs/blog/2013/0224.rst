========

- Moved the renderers from :mod:`lino.ui` to a new :mod:`lino.ui.render`,
  and the ExtJS renderer to another :mod:`lino.ui.extjs`.
  One day I plan to turn Lino's ExtJS UI into a separate project so that 
  I can convert the other parts of Lino from GPL to BSD
  (see :doc:`/tickets/16`)


- Oops, RequestField weren't correctly rendered in an ExtJS grid.
  This bug must have sneaked in quite some time ago 
  when I moved formatting from `store` to `elem`.
  For the moment that's okay, but medium-term I noted :doc:`/tickets/75`.
