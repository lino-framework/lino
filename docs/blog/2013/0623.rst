Lino learns Portuguese (continued)
----------------------------------

:mod:`lino.management.commands.show`: 
added new command-line parameter `--language`
and optimized it to not do things which are done by
:meth:`lino.core.requests.BaseRequest.spawn`.

Added a project :mod:`lino.projects.i18n`
and a tested docs page :ref:`lino.tested.i18n`.

Found the explanation why Django doesn't 
find the `pt-br` locales:
because Lino had no `pt` locale.

-   In Django you cannot have a variant of a language 
    without having the base language.
    The advantage of this sophistication is that 
    `pt-br` automatically inherits from `pt`.

Flavio, what's the difference 
between Brazilian Portuguese and plain Portuguese?
Are you able to maintain both locales?


The :ref:`lino.tested.i18n` page was still failing 
because 
:meth:`atelier.test.TestCase.run_simple_doctests` 
uses `python -m doctest` 
which doesn't let us specify an input encoding for 
the file.
It was a well-known bug that 
:meth:`atelier.test.TestCase.run_simple_doctests` 
didn't yet support non-ascii characters.

Now it does. 
Had to add a new module :mod:`atelier.doctest_utf8`
for this. 
Because we need to run each doctest in a separate subprocess 
and because the command-line interface
of `python -m doctest`  has no way to specify an encoding 
of the input file.
