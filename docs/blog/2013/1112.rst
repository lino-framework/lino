Tutorial about database change auditing
---------------------------------------

Joe asked whether Lino can do audit trails (history log). 
Yes it does. 
At least something similar.
Here is the beginning of a tutorial:
:doc:`/tutorials/watch_tutorial/index`.



I added a new ``demo`` fixture for :mod:`lino.modlib.countries` 
which yields both 
:mod:`few_countries <lino.modlib.countries.fixtures.few_countries>`
and
:mod:`few_cities <lino.modlib.countries.fixtures.few_cities>`.
This is to avoid having to specify ``few_countries few_cities`` in 
:setting:`demo_fixtures` of Sites which use 
:mod:`lino.modlib.countries`.
As a consequence `lino_welfare/modlib/cbss/fixtures/demo.py` 
had to be removed, and :setting:`demo_fixtures` 
for :ref:`welfare` changed accordingly. 
Which in the end is clearer than before.


Started the next release of :ref:`welfare`
------------------------------------------

- Incremented version counter of :ref:`welfare`
- Started the migration method
