Authentication against an LDAP server
---------------------------------------

Thanks to Josef Kejzlar LDAP is now among Lino's out-of-the-box authentication methods. 
He contributed a snippet which I integrated into Lino
as a new setting :setting:`ldap_auth_server`
(and a new middleware :class:`lino.core.auth.LDAPAuthMiddleware`
which is automatically being installed).

When using the latest development version you should be able to use it 
by specifying in your :xfile:`settings.py`::

    ldap_auth_server = 'DOMAIN_NAME SERVER_DNS'

The :setting:`auth_middleware` setting is still useful in case somebody
wants to use yet another custom authentication method. 

Internal changes: 

- moved `make_permission_handler` 
  and `make_view_permission_handler` from 
  :mod:`lino.core.auth`
  to :mod:`lino.core.perms`.

- I used the fact that Django *instantiates* the MW classes at server 
  startup in order to import the module and acquire domain credentials 
  (`creds = Creds(domain)`) only once. I don't know how expensive this 
  is, but now it is no longer done for every request. 
  

  This required to change the `authenticate` methods 
  of :class:`AuthMiddleWareBase <lino.core.auth.AuthMiddleWareBase>`
  and subclasses into instance 
  methods. (Don't remember why they were class methods).
