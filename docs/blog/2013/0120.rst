========

I discovered 
`extjs-public
<http://code.google.com/p/extjs-public/>`_,
a repository containing the latest public release of ExtJS.
This is now being used as default value 
for :attr:`lino.Lino.extjs_base_url`.
One thing less to install before getting started with Lino.

Worked again on ticket :doc:`/tickets/69`.
Although there's hope that this is going to change soon
because we have now 
`Distribute <http://packages.python.org/distribute/>`_.

Added some screenshots to :doc:`/demos`. 
Which required some time for
translations and 
experimenting with Django's latest development version.
(One day I should try to switch to Python 3, shouldn't I?)
