======================================

Until now the "Show this table as a pdf document" action was implemented
in :xfile:`linoweb.js` and :mod:`lino.ui.views`.
Now I converted it to a "real" action
:class:`PdfTableAction <lino.utils.appy_pod.PdfTableAction>`.
Because I wanted to know whether Lino can do it.
He can. Congratulations!

This has several advantages:

- The mechanism is no longer split
  across several files but all in one place.

- Added new file 
  :srcref:`Table-portrait.odt </lino/config/Table-portrait.odt>`,
  almost the same as 
  :srcref:`Table.odt </lino/config/Table.odt>`.
  Applications can override the default PdfTableAction
  in order to use this portrait version::

    class Countries(dd.Table):
        ...
        as_pdf = PdfTableAction(template_name = "Table-portrait.odt")
  

Now I'll also want to convert the html, csv and delete actions.
The delete action is most urgent because users cannot delete multiple 
rows at once.

But first I have another idea for a third advantage of this:
I wrote a derived class
:class:`PdfLabelsAction <lino.utils.appy_pod.PdfLabelsAction>`
and a template
:srcref:`/lino/config/Labels.odt`,
and added this to `contacts.Partner`.
Bingo.
Except for a little detail: it prints only one page of labels.

Removed the :class:`lino.site.Site` methods
`get_letter_margin_top`
and
`get_letter_margin_bottom`
and replaced them by two templates
:srcref:`letter_margin_top.html </lino/config/letter_margin_top.html>`
and
:srcref:`letter_margin_bottom.html </lino/config/letter_margin_bottom.html>`
