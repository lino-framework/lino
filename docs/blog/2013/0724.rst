==================================

Continued to work
on the :ref:`welfare.reception` module.

Added a "Quick appointment" action which
creates (1) a calendar event that belongs to the selected user
and (2) a checked-in Guest for this event.

Actions
-------

I added a new virtual column
:meth:`action_buttons <lino.core.model.Model.action_buttons>`
which is similar to the existing
:meth:`workflow_buttons <lino.core.model.Model.workflow_buttons>` column.
The new attribute :attr:`lino.core.actions.Action.show_in_row_actions`
defines whether this action should be displayed in this column.

The difference is subtle:
it does not display the state, nor does it automatically include 
any state change actions.
The whole system for defining actions is not yet really 
transparent and consistent.


Secretaries
-----------

Is "secretary" a "user role" (currently called "level") or a 
"functional group"?
The answer to this question depends on the application. 
The framework should not make some presumption.

The reception clerk should not see the contacts module.
I think the best solution for this is to change
the general :mod:`lino.modlib.contacts` module
so that these commands also require `user_groups='office'`.

The default `UserLevels` had an entry "secretary", 
situated between "guest" and "user". 
I renamed this (back) to "restricted".

The "restricted" user level was used in 
:mod:`lino.modlib.postings`: 
the idea was that "secretaries" do certain general jobs 
for the "specialists".
They are members of these "user groups", 
but have less rights than the real users. 
They are more than "guests" however.
Thus the need for an intermediate level.
But this was maybe an unnecessary complication. 
Removed it. Waiting for user feedback.


The two actions to manage Belgian eID cards
(which were previously in 
:mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.pcsw.models`) 
are now in a separate 
module :mod:`lino.modlib.reception.beid`.

The :ref:`welfare.reception` module starts to get ready,
but two technical challenges are yet TODO:

- There are two ways to 
  execute the "Read eID card" action on a client: 
  using the toolbar button and using the JS link of the new "Actions" 
  field. The latter doesn't work because the JS isn't correct.
  
- Theresia sees the :ref:`welfare.reception.ExpectedGuests` table
  rendered as HTML in her `admin_main.html`, very nice, 
  but the "Checkout" actions don't work from there.
