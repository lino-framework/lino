================================


The docs below `/admin` need a serious redesign and most of 
them are currently obsolete.
While working on them I noticed that 
the first argument to :meth:`djangosite.Site.__init__` 
was a useless requirement: 
if a file passes its `globals()` dictionary, 
there is no need to also ask for the value of the `__file__` 
key of that same dictionary!


I'll use the freedom I have as long as the only known production 
servers are maintained by myself
and do a backwards incompatbile change in the :doc:`/ref/settings`:


Adapt your :file:`settings.py` files!
-------------------------------------

Lino until now required to write in your :file:`settings.py` file::

  SITE = Site(__file__,globals(),...)
  
Now you just write::  
  
  SITE = Site(globals(),...)


Moving towards a pluggable user interface
-----------------------------------------

I am working on moving towards a pluggable user interface.
One benefit of this will be :doc:`/tickets/16`.

The :meth:`lino.ui.base.Handle.__init__` no longer 
takes the `ui` as argument.
