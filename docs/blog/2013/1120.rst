Emacs configuration
-------------------

Switching from Geany to Emacs is not for free, it costs quite 
some hours of fiddling with configuration files.

Especially auto-completing class attributes 
is not out-of-the-box. I agree with Joe that this is an 
important feature for an IDE.

I added a new short command to my :file:`.bash_aliases`::

  function e() { 
    $EDITOR $* 
  }

Until now I had always typed "gea" TAB "filename". 
Imagine what a waste of time! 

But then I wasted quite some time to get auto-completion 
running:

- `PythonProgrammingInEmacs
  <http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/PythonProgrammingInEmacs>`_

- `elpy Emacs Python Development Environment
  <https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy>`_

- `How to install emacs 24.3 on Ubuntu?
  <http://askubuntu.com/questions/297170/how-to-install-emacs-24-3-on-ubuntu>`_

- `Warning: cl package required at runtime
  <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5019724/in-emacs-what-does-this-error-mean-warning-cl-package-required-at-runtime>`_

And still most names don't expand because elpy cannot import most modules 
because no `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is set...


Continued with :ref:`tim2lino`
------------------------------

:mod:`lino.projects.presto.fixtures.tim2lino` started to also 
import Bank Statements, Payment orders and Journal Entries.

Note that::
    
    foo = dd.resolve_app('foo')
    
is not the same as::

    foo = settings.SITE.modules.foo
    
or::

    from lino.runtime import foo
