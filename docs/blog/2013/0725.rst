Fixed one Javascript bug
------------------------

One of yesterday's two "technical challenges" seems solved:
executing the "Read eID card" action on a client 
using the javascript link of the new "Actions" 
field now works.
  
Since all this is very complex and not automatically tested, 
it might cause surprises at the Javascript level somewhere 
in the future.
So I marked this change with "AFTER_20130725" in `linoweb.js` 
and `extjs/__init__.py`

The second challenge is even more sophisticated and not yet solved:

- A reception clerk sees the :ref:`welfare.reception.ExpectedGuests` table
  rendered as HTML in their `admin_main.html`, very nice, 
  but the "Checkout" actions don't work from there.

Buttons for actions with parameters aren't yet possible 
when rendering to plain HTML.
But Lino now at least says 
"Sorry, this action don't work when called directly from the Home page".


:mod:`lino.mixins.beid`
-----------------------

Created :class:`lino.mixins.beid.BeIdCardHolder`.
Transferred translations from `lino_welfare` to `lino`.


:mod:`lino_faggio`
------------------

- Moved `admin_main.html` to the correct location
- Replaced `InvoiceablePartners` by a new approach `InvoicesToIssue`
  based on a virtual table.
- Moved the definition of virtual fields `workflow_buttons` 
  and `action_buttons` from :mod:`lino.core.model` to :mod:`lino.core.actors`.
