Writing an extension for Firefox
--------------------------------

Does it make sense to implement :ref:`eidreader` 
as a browser extension (not as a Java applet)?

Before I can even decide whether this *question* makes sense, 
I should invest a few hours into how it would look like.

I discovered a cool tutorial for getting started: `Shortest Tutorial
for Firefox Extension/Toolbar Development!
<http://devilsworkshop.org/tips/shortest-tutorial-for-firefox-extensiontoolbar-development/347/>`_
written in 2007(!) by Rahul Bansai.  Cool! Got it running within one
hour!  Thanks to Rahul Bansai for this great entry point.


TODO (in case I decide to abandon the Java implementation):

Maybe I must build classes and jar files using Oracle Java?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Another desperate attempt to get :ref:`eidreader` working
on an Oracle Java under Windows XP.
(Remember :blogref:`20131128`).

::

    $ sudo update-java-alternatives -s java-7-oracle
    $ make clean
    $ make jars

Result: nope :-(

The problem is very stable, so I wrote a ticket for it:
:doc:`/tickets/2013/1`.
