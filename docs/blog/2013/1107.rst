Multiple choice surveys
-----------------------

While answering an innocent little 
`Poll about Python Usage
<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1FjCpkXBQjQhVQ8ln9LqtSLAHuRASEfKnPoQqhUfDAPg/viewform>`_,
I realized that :ref:`polly` cannot currently 
do multiple choice surveys.
Could not withhold myself from starting to implement it.
A `polls.Answer` is now a *volatile* object which is 
stored as a series of model instances.
The `AnswersByresponse` table is where the magic happens,
a new challenge for Lino: an *editable* virtual table.
Discovered and fixed a typo bug in `ResponsesByPoll` which had caused 
it to be empty during the demo last night.

TODO:

- The "My answer" column of `AnswersByresponse` currently just lists 
  the possible choices without a means to change them.
