Fixed a typo bug in :manage:`watch_tim`.


I asked my wife to create a logo for Lino, 
and she asked me to first tell her: "What is Lino?".
I answered "It's a framework for writing database applications 
using Django and ExtJS..." -- She interrupted me: 
"No, I mean: what is Lino *really*? 
What's important about Lino?".
It took me then several hours to discover and formulate myself 
what Lino *really* means:
:doc:`/about/values`.
