Does Lino need a new name?
--------------------------

My wife and I were thinking about a logo for Lino (see
:blogref:`20130926`), and I noticed that I feel
certain problems:

- Resemblance with "Linux" (e.g. my non-programmer friends usually
  mix them up)
- It is used by certain specialized products in printing technology
  (Linotronic, Linoprint)
- Americans don't know how to pronounce it
- It is not easy to change a name, but I'd rather do it now than 
  in 5 years.

... and oops: while surfing around I discovered that 
"Lino" is registered trademark of a 
German software company (http://www.lino.de).

Does that mean that Lino needs a new name?
AFAICS this means only that
they *might* ask us to change our name
*if they feel disturbed* 
by the fact that we use the same name.
*As long as they don't feel disturbed*, there is no problem at all.
And I can't imagine that they would.
And even *if* they would (who knows), 
then they would have to leave us a reasonable 
lapse of time to change our name.

Currently I think it is better to *not* change our name for
the moment because 

- a few dozen people know and love Lino the framework, and many of them 
  would be disappointed if we would change the name
- there is no serious replacement candidate so far
- it would cause quite some of work, and there are more important 
  things to do

Started a new page :doc:`/about/name`.
Comments are welcome.

I guess that it comes when the applet tries to load one of the 
third-party .jar files. Are they signed?

Trying to reproduce this problem locally on a Windows XP in a VirtualBox.

One problem was that the virtual machine doesn't see any USB device at all.
I solved that thanks to 
`How To Use Host USB Device From Guest In VirtualBox
<http://techtooltip.wordpress.com/2008/09/22/how-to-use-host-usb-device-from-guest-in-virtual-box/>`_
Need to connect the read before starting the VM and add a USB filter 
in the VirtualBox settings.

Another problem was that Windows then didn't find a suitable driver for this device.
I googled for "windows omnikey smart card driver" and found the page
http://www.hidglobal.com/drivers/16251
where I downloaded the first PCSC driver they suggested.

Uff, after over 2 hours of fiddling: now I can reproduce the problem!
And its far beyond feierabend.
The problem itself remains for tomorrow.
Again, Java is causing me hours of frustrating work.


Confirmation : when in an applet i call a method which requires a 
client-side permission in the policy file, then it is not enough to ask 
my users to give that permission. That works only on OpenJDK (icedtea). 
But on Sun Java I must additionally wrap every such call into a 
construct like these::

    AccessController.doPrivileged(new PrivilegedAction() { 
      public Object run() { my code ... } 
    });

    return (String) AccessController.doPrivileged(new PrivilegedAction() { 
        public Object run() { my code ... return X; }


Updated `EIDREader.java` accordingly. Now it reads already my 
Estonian eid card.

But trying to read my Belgian card gives a new error::

  java.lang.SecurityException: trusted loader attempted to 
  load sandboxed resource from file:/t:/applets/eid-applet-service.jar

I added `Trusted-Library: true` to my `Manifest.txt` and re-signed. 
Now there's neither an error message nor a result, nor any output 
to the Java console!
The applet just exits and that's all.
This happens as soon as it calls
`TlvParser.parse()` (which has been 
imported from `be.fedict.eid.applet.service.impl.tlv.TlvParser`.
