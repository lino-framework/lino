Last adaptions in test suites after yesterday's changes.

UnicodeEncodeError
==================

I had a UnicodeEncodeError when running the :manage:`show` command::

    $ python manage.py show pcsw.StrangeClients

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
      File ".../lino/core/renderer.py", line 308, in show_request
        print(ar.to_rst(*args, **kw))
    UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xe9' in position 1712: ordinal not in range(128)

But Lino was innocent. It was because the terminal or the system was
poorly configured.  See https://wiki.python.org/moin/PrintFails

My ~/.bashrc contained::

  export LANG=en_GB.UTF-8

and I solved it by changing this to::

  export LANG=C.UTF-8

after invoking ``locale -a`` in order to see which locales are
available::

    $ locale -a
    C
    C.UTF-8
    POSIX
    fr_BE.utf8


Another workaround was to set :envvar:`PYTHONIOENCODING` to "utf-8".


Repairable data
===============

Tonight I had the inspiration for solving a series of subtle but
disturbing problems:  

- pcsw.Clients with an SSIN which actually is valid, but wrongly
  formatted
- Partners with a single address, but which is not marked as primary
- Calendar events which should have their client as guest, but they
  don't have 

The solution is a new module :mod:`lino.mixins.repairable` and a
management command :manage:`repairdata`.

The first
item of above list is already implemented, tested by
:mod:`lino_welfare.projects.std.tests.test_beid`.  I also worked on the
documentation of :mod:`lino.utils.ssin`.
The other two items are for tomorrow...
