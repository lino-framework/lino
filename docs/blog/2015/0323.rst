Teaching takes time
===================

Yesterday Mahmoud and I worked on :ticket:`38`, it was very
interesting for us and good for Lino... but now I had another two
hours of work for getting the test suite to pass again under Django
1.6 :-)

- :func:`choicelist_choices
  <lino.core.choicelists.choicelist_choices>` used by the
  :attr:`choicelist
  <lino.modlib.properties.modules.PropType.choicelist>` field of
  :class:`properties.PropType <lino.modlib.properties.modules.PropType>`.

- The `ChoiceList.class_init` we introduced yesterday forgot to call
  `super`.


Release in Eupen
================

Instead of increasing the version number and writing a migrator, I
manually removed the following line in the :xfile:`restore.py` file
generated by that version of Lino::

    # execfile("dupable_partners_word.py")

Uncommenting a line of code is less work that writing a migrator.

I also invoked this manually::

    $ python manage.py check_plausibility

New test case for duplicate clients
===================================

Our three concrete cases of duplicate clients in Eupen were still not
detected due to a minor bug in :meth:`find_similar_instances
<lino_welfare.modlib.dupable_clients.mixins.DupableClient.find_similar_instances>`
of :class:`DupableClient
<lino_welfare.modlib.dupable_clients.mixins.DupableClient>`. Fixed the
bug and wrote a test case :mod:`test_dupe_clients
<lino_welfare.projects.std.tests.test_dupe_clients>` to verify it.



Session with Mahmoud
====================

Some notes during our next session.

I noticed that the term "management command" in the Django
documentation has been replaced by "django-admin command". Seems that
I must update the Lino documentation accordingly.

We discovered another black hole in the documentation:
:doc:`/dev/site_config`.

Mahmoud asked "Why do I need to pass this `globals()` when
instantiating a SITE?", and it took me more than a minute to find the
answer in the documentation. And this answer then was not deep enough
to be useful.  The missing piece for him was that "global", in Python
means "per module" and not "per process".

The big chain of imports of many subclasses of the
:class:`lino.core.site.Site` class can seem confusing.  But it gives
us a hierarchy of places where we can define and override attributes
and methods of an application.

For example:

- :class:`lino.core.site.Site`
- :mod:`lino.projects.std.settings`
- :mod:`lino.projects.min1.settings`
- :mod:`lino.projects.min1.settings.demo`

Or:

- :class:`lino.core.site.Site`
- :mod:`lino.projects.std.settings`
- :mod:`lino_welfare.projects.std.settings`
- :mod:`lino_welfare.projects.eupen.settings`
- :mod:`lino_welfare.projects.eupen.settings.demo`
