About GenericForeignKey fields
==============================

I continued to research and document about GFK fields in
:doc:`/dev/gfks`.  :doc:`/tutorials/gfks/index`.

I understood that the `allow_stale_generic_foreignkey` attribute can
be replaced by a nullable `ForeignKey`, so I removed this feature and
adapted the only place where it was used (:mod:`lino.modlib.changes`).

I added a column "Action" to the :class:`BrokenGFKs
<lino.modlib.contenttypes.models.BrokenGFKs>` table.  See
:meth:`get_broken_generic_related
<lino.core.kernel.Kernel.get_broken_generic_related>`.

TODO: A hopefully last thing is a management command to cleanup broken
GFK fields. This would execute the suggested actions (delete and
clear) without any further user interaction.


RefundConfirmation has no doctor_type
=====================================

This bug occured in Eupen in yesterday's version.  The reason was that
:meth:`create_doctor_choice
<lino_welfare.modlib.aids.models.RefundConfirmation.create_doctor_choice>`
may not do::

    if not self.doctor_type:

but must do::

    if not self.doctor_type_id:

This is because :attr:`doctor_type
<lino_welfare.modlib.aids.models.RefundConfirmation.doctor_type>` is
not nullable, and because Django behaves oddly in that case.  I told
them already `5 years ago
<https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/12801>`__ that this behaviour
is odd, but they don't listen to me.  Oh (wow!) I just noticed that `3
months ago <https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/12708#comment:7>`__
they even started to consider that I might be right. Thanks,
`simon29`.
  
I also wrote a docstring for
:meth:`ForeignKeyStoreField.parse_form_value
<lino.core.store.ForeignKeyStoreField.parse_form_value>`.
