How to specify the aid type per Client
======================================

In :mod:`lino_welfare.projects.chatelet` they need either the
`pcsw.Client.aids_type` field or a minimal version of
:mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.aids` (the :class:`aids.GrantingsByClient
<lino_welfare.modlib.aids.models.GrantingsByClient>` panel in
pcsw.ClientDetail) in order to print this information on an ISIP
contract.  I activated the latter. It is more complicated than what
they ask (they ask for just a combobox) but more future-oriented.

Cannot save RichTextField when editing in own window
====================================================

And it seems that I also managed to fix ticket :ticket:`131`. Nice.
