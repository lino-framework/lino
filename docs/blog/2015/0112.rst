Some fine-tuning in :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.reception`.

.. currentmodule:: lino_welfare.modlib.reception.models

Renamed `CreateEventActionsByClient` to
:class:`FindDateByClientTable`.  Moved `ButtonsTable` to
:class:`lino.core.tables.ButtonsTable`.

We had the following ordering of buttons on pcsw.Client:
:guilabel:`Find date with`, :guilabel:`Read eID card`,
:guilabel:`Create promt event`.  The button for :guilabel:`Read eID
card` was "at the wrong place": it must be either *before* or *after*
the two other actions.  This was because :class:`ShowSlaveTable
<lino.core.actions.ShowSlaveTable>` did not yet (as it should) copy
over the :attr:`sort_index <lino.core.actors.Actor.sort_index>`
specified on the table to the :attr:`sort_index
<lino.core.actions.Action.sort_index>`.  of the action.  Yet another
bug in the framework fixed!

The list of users to display in :class:`FindDateByClientTable` must
not include `watch_tim`.  New function :func:`find_date_with_users`.

Note that we cannot currently make that list depend on the client's
:attr:`lino_welfare.modlib.pcsw.models.Client.client_state` or the
clerk's user profile. That's because choosers know neither the
requesting user nor the `master_instance` of the query.  A missing
feature which might be useful to implement some day: ticket
:ticket:`56`.
