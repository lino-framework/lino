On March 30, 2015, as part of the process of decentralizing the Lino
development, we moved Luc's "Lino developer blog" out the Lino
documentation tree.

Luc's blog is now available at http://luc.lino-framework.org

We are doing our best to install automatic redirections.
Meanwhile please translate the URLs yourself:
