# 50 : initdb causes "foreign key constraint fails" 
===================================================

One user reports the following error message during :term:`initdb`::

  django.db.utils.IntegrityError: (1217, 'Cannot delete or update a parent row: a foreign key constraint fails') 

We were not able to reproduce this on :term:`Jana`.
But the Django code of the flush command shows indeed that the
`sql_flush` method of `django.db.backends.mysql.base.DatabaseOperations` 
does quite some tricks and uses ``SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS``.

But Django's `flush` management command calls this only on Django tables.
