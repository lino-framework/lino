#25 : `makedoc` command
=======================

Idea: a Django management command that creates a series 
of .rst files in a local directory, called the "site docs".

This will be useful for 
- debugging (e.g. it shows the content of each model's `_lino_ddh`)
- reference documentation for the local site manager and end-users
