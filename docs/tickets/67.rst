#67 : Write a jQuery-based GUI
==============================

The expected main advantage of a jQuery-based user interface
comparend to ExtJS is better performance. 
ExtJS is quite heavy and makes Lino look and feel rather slow.

One problem is Brian Moeskau's great work of the Extensible 
calendar application. But even this exists in jQuery:
Adam Shaw's 
`FullCalendar <http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/>`_.


`Here <http://www.onlinecompanyportal.com/sts/>`_
is an example integrated in a demo application 
functionally similar to 
http://demo3.lino-framework.org.
