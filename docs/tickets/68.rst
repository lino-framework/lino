#68 : Automatically update invoice total when item changed
==========================================================

The total fields of an invoice are currently not automatically 
updated each time an item is modified. 
Users must click the Save or the Register button to see the invoices totals.


One idea is to have
:meth:`lino.modlib.vat.models.VatItemBase.after_ui_save` 
insert a `refresh_all=True`
(into the response to the PUT or POST coming from 
Lino.GridPanel.on_afteredit).
This has the disadvantage that the cell cursor moves 
to the upper left corner after each cell edit.

You can see how this feels by setting 
:meth:`lino.modlib.vat.models.VatDocument.refresh_after_item_edit` 
to True.
