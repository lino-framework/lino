#69 [closed] : Where to store the version number?
=================================================

It seems that there is no "official" way
to store the version number of a Python project 
in a single central place.

Lino's :xfile:`setup.py` does an ``import lino`` to take it 
from :attr:`lino.Site.version`. 
That's okay for me the author who just uses :xfile:`setup.py`
to ``sdist`` and ``upload``.
But ``setup.py install`` of course wouldn't work.

Because there are so many different (and partly incompatible) answers,
and no official statement, I prefer to wait and see 
as long as there is no concrete problem report.
