#65 : Class-based views
=======================

Lino doesn't yet use Django's `Class-based views
<http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/class-based-views/>`_ 
because this concept didn't yet exist when I started.
(I discovered it in :doc:`March 2011 </blog/2011/0311>`)

- The concept sounds good
- The old function-based views will be deprecated in Django 1.5
- Ticket :doc:`/tickets/64` is waiting for this.
