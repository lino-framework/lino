Installation
-------------

Get a local copy of the repository from github, e.g. using::

  $ git clone https://github.com/lsaffre/eidreader.git

The files `example/*.html` 
are usage examples and should work out of the box.

TODO: Write instructions on how to setup the client, perhaps integrate
with :ref:`davlink.client`
