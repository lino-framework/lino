- you need a Belgien eID card and a card reader
- eid-applet must be in your classPath or in the :file:`àpplets` 
  directory as described in :ref:`eidreader.install`
- open the file :file:`applets/eid_test.html` in your browser.
  Hint: 
  invoking the browser from the command line will make the 
  java console visible.

    $ firefox applets/eid_test.html
