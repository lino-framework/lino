Lino Presto

Lino Presto is an application for managing the work of Rumma & Ko OÜ.
"Presto" means "quick" in Italian, and in French it reminds
"prestations de service" (providements of services?)

**Status: not yet usable**

It is a seamless combination of the following general functionalities:

- Accounting (general ledger, sales, purchases, VAT declarations, bank journals, ...)
- Project management, issue tracking, generating service reports and invoices for services.
- Subscription management (generating regular invoices based 
  to subscription contracts)
- Content management, blogs, newsletters and classical web pages

Lino-Presto is not yet usable.  When one day it will be ready, we plan
it to be reusable by other service providers such as software
developers, tax consultants, accountants,...
