Changes 2009
============

20090213
--------

Configurable boldness

Okay, it seems that not all printer drivers behave correctly when they
get «unusual» font weights. New testcase 
srcref:`tests/textprinter/3.py` 
shows whether your
configured PostScript printer does it right. On the other hand the
"Courier New" font looks «too lightweight» to many people on most
printers. So I must make this option customizable. 

N.B.: :mod:`win32.lib.win32con` defines the following names::

  FW_DONTCARE = 0 
  FW_THIN = 100 
  FW_EXTRALIGHT = 200 
  FW_LIGHT = 300 
  FW_NORMAL = 400 
  FW_MEDIUM = 500 
  FW_SEMIBOLD = 600 
  FW_BOLD = 700 
  FW_EXTRABOLD = 800 
  FW_HEAVY = 900 
  FW_ULTRALIGHT = FW_EXTRALIGHT 
  FW_REGULAR = FW_NORMAL 
  FW_DEMIBOLD = FW_SEMIBOLD 
  FW_ULTRABOLD = FW_EXTRABOLD 
  FW_BLACK = FW_HEAVY



20090227
--------

:doc:`../timtools/index` 0.6.42 released:

- The boldness of bold and normal text is now configurable for
  prnprint.py
  (see [ref NEW:492 How bold is bold? (14.04.07)]).           


20090418
--------

I discovered that :meth:`lino.textprinter.pdfprn.PdfTextPrinter.insertImage`
has changed its behaviour between `0.6.37 <20071123_>`  and 
`0.6.42 <20090227>`_.
Maybe because I upgraded the ReportLab toolkit between those releases. 

PdfTextPrinter.insertImage() does not support *behindText*.
Images are always placed over any text that occurs before them in 
the input file.


20090419 Working on tests
-------------------------

- runtests.py now recurses into subdirs.

- Started to move configuration options from "lino.config" to application-specific options. The first option is
  :configcmd:`postscript_printer`.
  Its definition has moved 
  from the obsolete global :xfile:`lino.cfg` file to a new file :xfile:`runtest.ini`.
  Until now it was accessed in testcases by::
  
    config.win32.get('postscript_printer')
    
  New access code::
  
    self.runtests.options.postscript_printer

- moved my_import and tsttools from lino.misc to lino.tools


20090510
--------

- (Many undocumented changes during the last weeks.)

- :class:`Instantiator` now supports many-to-many fields. 
  Content of a many-to-many field can now be specified as a string 
  containing a space-separated list of primary keys.
  Or, if you want to use another field than the primary key for specifying related objects, m2m_field:lookup_field syntax.
  Examples for both usages are in :srcref:`src/lino/django/songs/fixtures/demo.dpy`.
  

20090511
--------

- :mod:`mysites.demo.makedemo` now finds the list of installed apps automatically.
  So I no longer need to change :xfile:`makedemo.py` after changing
  :configcmd:`INSTALLED_APPS`.
  
  
- Worked on website pages 
  :doc:`../django/index` and
  :doc:`../about/what_is`.
  
- :meth:`Row.field_as_readonly` now supports when a value is a :class:`Manager` (which is the case when you specify a ManyToManyField).

- Classes :class`Singer` and :class`Author` are now subclasses of :class`Person`.

- Started `Common models`_

- updated my copy of Django from 10618 to 10736


Common models
-------------

:class`Language` and :class`Country` are a first example of 
models being used by several applications. They are now defined in
:mod:`lino.django.utils`.

The order of applications in :configcmd:`INSTALLED_APPS` becomes
important: :func:`lino_setup` is called in that order.
  
This way of doing has unresolved issues:
  - cannot make a common class become abstract
  - cannot remove a menu item or change order of menu items



20090513
--------

- Added Collection and Places to songs.models. 
  Added sample data in songs/fixtures/demo.dpy.
- Instantiator now supports a lookup_field for ForeignKey.

20090514
--------

- Worked on :xfile:`/src/lino/django/igen/fixtures/demo.dpy`.

- Added :class:`lino.django.igen.models.Contract`.

- I noticed that Django's DateField does no validation and no conversion from string to date. :class:`lino.django.utils.instantiator.DateConverter`
  How to parse a datetime.date from a string? 
  The standard Python module has now support at all, even not to 
  parse a simple iso-formatted date. `PEP 321 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0321/>`_ was exactly what I'd need now, but it has been withdrawn... I also read
  http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2004-April/044181.html
  and
  http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2003-November/236842.html
  
  Conclusion: I started by writing a parse_date() myself, then I understood that I also need other things from python-dateutil, so I threw it away and added dateutils to :meth:`lino.django.utils.sites.LinoSite.tanks_to`.
  
20090519
--------

- preparing for field-specific default width in Layouts            

- :meth:`Row.field_as_readonly` now sets ``style="width:100%"`` when  :attr:`Element.width`is `None`.

- removed `null=True` from string fields after reading 
  http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/fields/#null
  
- New :class:`GRID_CELL` to render more than one field in a single 
  grid cell. 
 
- Started :class:`igen.models.MakeInvoicesDialog`. 
  A Dialog is an enhanced django.forms.Form that can be installed as a menu action.
  In Module :mod:`render`: 
  started to split new class ElementServer out of Row
  because Dialog will need only the ElementServer part of Row.
  
20090520
--------

- Good news: 
  `Active Systems <http://www.active.ee>`_ is probably going to participate in the development of igen.
  We started an issues tracker on their server at
  http://code.active.ee:3000/projects/lino/issues  
  We also wrote some Wiki pages:
  https://code.active.ee/wiki/doku.php?id=igen:igen

20090521
--------

- Merged :class:`Contract` into :class:`Order`. A contract is just a cyclic Order.

- Worked on :meth:`Order.make_invoice`.
  make_invoice() will have to know when the next billing will occur.
  And whether a service must be paid for before or afterwards the period.
  For the moment we simplify by saying that the billing happens once per month.

  
- The old question again: which documentation system to use?
  `Doxygen <http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/>`_ 
  and
  `breathe <http://github.com/michaeljones/breathe/tree/master>`_?
  After playing around I continue to believe that documentation 
  must be maintained outside of the source code.
  Result for today: :doc:`../django/igen/index`.

- Pro-rata : the covered period in a generated invoice may be longer or shorter than
  normal in certain cases. 
  
  For example assume that invoices are sent only once a month, for
  example on the first working day of each month.
  What should we do if a monthly service order starts at the 28th of a
  month? Or at the 5th of the month? 
  :class:`Order` should get a new field, called maybe "Pro-rata".
  Definition of "Pro-rata": see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-rata.
  For the moment we simplify by saying that the covered period never 
  adapts automatically to the billing cycle.
  
  
20090522
--------

- The new class attributes :attr:`reports.Report.filter` and
  :attr:`reports.Report.exclude` refer to the corresponding Django methods to limit a queryset.
  
- Issue `edit a report's grid view fails <http://code.active.ee:3000/issues/show/342>`_

- Report extensively uses sime class attribut overriding in subclasses. That's what I want, but it has one disadvantage: typo's are not detected. :meth:`Report.__init__` now tries to detect them. This can be switched off by setting :attr:`Report.typo_check` to False.

- New module :mod:`lino.django.utils.perms` with some shortcuts :func:`perms.is_staff`, :func:`perms.is_authenticated` and :func:`perms.never`.
  Trying this on `Invoices.can_view = is_staff`,
  `Orders.can_view = is_authenticated` and
  `InvoicesToSend.can_add = never`.

20090523
--------

- Why did I try to write my own permissions system? because I don't like the system suggested by :mod:`django.contrib.auth`. 
  "but it's not currently possible to say "Mary may change news stories, but only the ones she created herself" or "Mary may only change news stories that have a certain status, publication date or ID." The latter functionality is something Django developers are currently discussing."
  (http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/#permissions)
  
  Some trace of the discussion is here:
  http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/3011
  
  My conclusion: don't insist for the moment on permissions and user management. Make my perms module minimal but usable and use it temporarily until Django has a good solution.
  
20090524
--------

- continued on :mod:`lino.django.utils.perms`. Now it works.
  (Updated http://code.active.ee:3000/issues/show/338)

- fixed a bug in http://127.0.0.1:8000/voc/tree

- Committed revision 681.

20090525
--------

- worked on ticket http://code.active.ee:3000/issues/show/337
  - added DocItem.discount
  - added an example in demo
  
- new DecimalConverter in Instantiator. DecimalFields were stored as strings in the database. And Django didn't complain (maybe simply because I use the sqlite backend which allows such things).
  
- Committed revision 683.

20090526
--------

- bug in demo.dpy

- :meth:`DocItem.before_save` now always sets :attr:`DocItem.total` (except when unitPrice or qty is None).
  :meth:`DocItem.total_incl` no longer necessary.

- Committed revision 684.

- PaymentPerm.months and PaymentTerm.days.
  It's not yet clear how igen should decide which type of invoice to generate (normal or proforma).


20090601
--------

- removed unused scripts in mysites/demo. 
- renamed makedemo.py to reset_demo.py
- make_invoices.py is a script in mysites/demo 
  but later it might become a Django command.
  
- PendingOrders is the first example of a Report with a customized params_form.
  Changed the handling of Report parameters.

- OrderManager is my first usage of a manager. It is needed for PendingOrders

20090603
--------

- Foreign keys are now rendered as clickable links to the pointed object's page. Clickable Pointers. 
  - :meth:`lino.django.utils.sites.LinoSite.get_instance_url`
  - :class:`lino.django.utils.reports.ReportMetaclass`

20090604
--------

- New :class:`lino.django.igen.models.InvoicingTerm`
