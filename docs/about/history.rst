History
=======

Luc Saffre, the author of Lino, is also the author of :term:`TIM`, a
DOS-based framework for writing database applications for small
enterprises.  Lino is a successor for TIM.  TIM is over 20 years old,
but Luc continues to live from maintaining it and giving professional
support to its users.  TIM users have relatively wide-spread profiles,
ranging from the independant craftsman who writes 50 invoices per year
to the government agency with 30 users and hundreds of documents per
day.

Luc has been working on writing a successor for TIM **since the early
1990s**.  He has done and dropped projects in C++, PHP and Java.  In
`August 2013 <https://sourceforge.net/p/lino/news/>`_ he published a
first version of Lino on Sourceforge.

Since **August 2004** he's mostly working in Python. 
In **March 2009** he discovered :term:`Django` whose database model and application 
server concepts seem ideal for Lino. 
In **August 2009** he started to use the :term:`ExtJS` Javascript framework.

The first real-world Lino application started in a Belgian *Public
Centre for Social Welfare* (PCSW) in **January 2011**.  In **August
2012** we forked it into a separate project :ref:`welfare` in order to
make it maintainable by an independant organization.

In September 2012 we purchased the domain name `lino-framework.org`.

The second real-world Lino application started :doc:`in Czechia <joe>`
in **July 2013**.

Other registered Lino users: see :doc:`/community/index`.
