Why GPL?
========

Lino is published under the `GPL <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License>`_
because we want to make sure that our voluntary work will always 
belong to the general public and never be controlled 
by some proprietary organisation.

**Luc's statement on this subject**:

The BSD versus GPL discussion has a "religious" dimension.  The personal preference of a software developer seems to depend mainly on his or her life situation and beliefs. And as far as I can see, my personal faith is clear: the GPL is the only license that `"resists proprietary  vendors' attempts to embrace, extend and extinguish <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend_and_extinguish>`_".

I don't claim to understand the topic completely, so I'm open to comments and discussion, and maybe I'll even change my mind. One reason to make me change my mind might be if I hear that people who would otherwise collaborate on Lino, refrain from doing so because of the GPL licensing. Let me know if you are one of them. On the other hand, here are some thoughts of other developers against the GPL that *didn't* make me change my mind:

* "I do not wish to pay for my javascript framework, nor do I want 
  to be forced to GPL it, as is the only other option available 
  to me if I use ExtJS." 
  (`coderseye.com 2008-06-04 <http://coderseye.com/2008/why-i-didnt-switch-from-jquery-to-extjs-after-all.html>`_) 
  
  (My answer: It's because you want to make money with something 
  that you got for free. That's why I like the GPL: you may *use* 
  our work for free, but you may not *sell* our work. 
  A public common that allows people to take 
  without giving back wouldn't be sustainable.)
  
* "I do not wish (...) to show some of the ugly code I play around 
  with on “playground/testing” sites." 
  (`coderseye.com 2008-06-04 <http://coderseye.com/2008/why-i-didnt-switch-from-jquery-to-extjs-after-all.html>`_) 
  
  (My answer: 
  Don't worry, the GPL dosn't require you to write *beautiful* code. 
  You wouldn't be the only one who publishes 
  shamelessly ugly code. Just look at my code.)
