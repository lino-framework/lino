Administrator's Guide
=====================

This section is for system administrators who set up or maintain a 
server which hosts one or several Lino applications.
You are not expected to be a Python programmer.
Experience with hosting Django projects is useful, 
but if you are new we'll provide external links to the relevant entry points.
