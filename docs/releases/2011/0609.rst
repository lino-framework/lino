Version 1.1.13 (09.06.2011)
===========================

This release is just to get feedback on the new fixture 
:mod:`pp2lino <lino.apps.dsbe.fixtures.pp2lino>`,
a customized data import for a new user in Brussels. 

How to try it: 

- get the latest Lino source

- aptitude install mdbtools

- Copy a recent version of your database to 
  :file:`/usr/local/django/myproject/PPv5MasterCopie.mdb`
  (the file name is currently hard-coded, 
  let me know if you prefer another name).
  
- Try it out::
    
    cd /usr/local/django/myproject
    python manage.py initdb std all_countries all_cities be all_languages props pp2lino
      
  (that is, the same as `initdb_demo.sh` except that the last fixture "demo" is 
  replaced by "pp2lino".)
  
- Restart Apache and enjoy your data through Lino.
